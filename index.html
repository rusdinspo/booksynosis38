<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Fascism Today: What It Is and How to End It</h2><p><p>We can no longer ignore the fact that fascism is on the rise in the United States. What was once a fringe movement has been gaining cultural acceptance and political power for years. Rebranding itself as "alt-right" and riding the waves of both Donald Trump's hate-fueled populism and the anxiety of an abandoned working class, they have created a social force that has the ability to win elections and inspire racist street violence in equal measure.</p><p><i>Fascism Today</i> looks at the changing world of the far right in Donald Trump's America. Examining the modern fascist movement's various strains, Shane Burley has written an accessible primer about what its adherents believe, how they organize, and what future they have in the United States. The ascension of Trump has introduced a whole new vocabulary into our political lexicon&#x2014;white nationalism, race realism, Identitarianism, and a slew of others. Burley breaks it all down. From the tech-savvy trolls of the alt-right to esoteric Aryan mystics, from full-fledged Nazis to well-groomed neofascists like Richard Spencer, he shows how these racists and authoritarians have reinvented themselves in order to recruit new members and grow.</p><p>Just as importantly, <i>Fascism Today</i> shows how they can be fought and beaten. It highlights groups that have successfully opposed these twisted forces and outlines the elements needed to build powerful mass movements to confront the institutionalization of fascist ideas, protect marginalized communities, and ultimately stop the fascist threat.</p><p><b>Shane Burley</b> is a writer, filmmaker, and antifascist based in Portland, Oregon.</p></p><p>Shane Burley: Shane Burley is a writer and filmmaker based in Portland, Oregon. He has written for In These Times, Columbia Journalism Review, ThinkProgress, Waging Nonviolence, Roar Magazine, and Make/Shift, and has been interviewed on the topic of fascism by The Guardian, the Huffington Post, among others.<br><br><p>"No better volume exists to understand the nexus of alt-right bigotry and anti-fascist resistance in the United States than <em>Fascism Today</em>. Burley&#x2019;s work is an essential 'tool for opposition' that brings to bear years of in-depth research and investigation into the resurgence of the far right. To destroy fascism, we must first understand it&#x2014;that understanding starts here."&#x2014;Mark Bray, historian and author of <em>Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook</em></p><br><p>"<em>Fascism Today</em>&nbsp;clearly and accessibly contextualizes the current moment in the United States, as well as the varied tactics to combat it." &#x2014;<em>Portland Mercury</em></p><br><p>&#x201c;Burley leaves no stone unturned in this vigorous and indispensable&nbsp;guide to modern fascism and the interlocking movements that oppose&nbsp;it, issuing a clarion call for ethical, intersectional resistance.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Alexander Reid Ross, author of Against the Fascist Creep</p><br><p><em>"Shane Burley was one of the first people to recognize the influence of the Alt Right and closely track its political development and intellectual approach. I highly recommend&nbsp;<em>Fascism Today</em>&nbsp;as both an accessible and comprehensive account of the Alt Right and related white nationalist groups&#x2014;as well as their antifascist opposition."&#x2014;Spencer Sunshine, author of&nbsp;<em>Up in Arms: A Guide to Oregon&#x2019;s Patriot Movement</em><br></em></p><br><p>"Burley's work gives us the most thorough dissection of the different tendencies of the modern far-right in clear, jargon-free language.

Inspired by the power of these ads, Heather Andrea Williams uses slave narratives, letters, interviews, public records, and diaries to guide readers back to devastating moments of family separation during slavery when people were sold away from parents, siblings, spouses, and children. Williams explores the heartbreaking stories of separation and the long, usually unsuccessful journeys toward reunification. Examining the interior lives of the enslaved and freedpeople as they tried to come to terms with great loss, Williams grounds their grief, fear, anger, longing, frustration, and hope in the history of American slavery and the domestic slave trade. <br><br>Williams follows those who were separated, chronicles their searches, and documents the rare experience of reunion. She also explores the sympathy, indifference, hostility, or empathy expressed by whites about sundered black families. Williams shows how searches for family members in the post-Civil War era continue to reverberate in African American culture in the ongoing search for family history and connection across generations.<br><br></p><p>"Williams speaks to scholars and to everyone interested in African American roots and family history as she delves into the short-run and long-run impact of family instability and disruption.

Initially, the events seemed unrelated: a war in Fireroot between the dwarves and the fire dragons, blight in Stoneroot, and disputes throughout the realms. But as Merlin and Basil scour the realms, they begin to realize that looming behind the growing chaos is a single dark threat&#x2014;an enemy that they&#x2019;ve never encountered. One that must be stopped before all of Avalon is lost.</p><p> In this jaw-dropping sequel to the mega-hit Merlin&#x2019;s Dragon, T. A. Barron sends Merlin, Rhia, and Basil, the greatest dragon ever, on a mission across Avalon to root out this new enemy. But sacrifices will be made, relationships will be tested, and precious lives will be lost.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>T.A. Barron is the award-winning author of fantasy novels such as <i>The Lost Years of Merlin</i> epic&#x2014;soon to be a major motion picture. He serves on a variety of environmental and educational boards including The Nature Conservancy and The Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, and is the founder of a national award for heroic children. Following a life-changing decision to leave a successful business career to write full-time in 1990, Barron has written seventeen books, but is happiest when on the mountain trails with his wife, Currie, and their five children.<p> </p>Grade 6 Up&#x2014;Basil has become accustomed to his large size as a powerful dragon, his new name, and his greater role in the fate of his world. With Avalon teetering on the edge of catastrophe, he and Merlin search for ways to squelch the violence erupting throughout the realms. The action is packed with battles between dragons and dwarfs, crows and terns, and many more creatures of Avalon. Readers will also find new love, loss, and relationships on the brink. Unfortunately, the book suffers extensively from middle book syndrome. Too many subplots cause Basil, Merlin, and readers to lose sight of Rhita Gawr. As for Doomraga, readers will have to wait for the cliff-hanger ending to learn who he is, and for book three to read about his revenge. Of course, even with the problems, no one can compare to Barron when writing about Merlin or Avalon. Once again, he brings texture, color, and love to the seven realms. His many fans will gobble up this new offering, but new readers will need to start with book one.&#x2014;<i>Lisa Marie Williams, East Gwillimbury Public Library, Holland Landing, Ontario</i> END</p><h2>Watchmen</h2><p>&#34;Watchmen&#34; redefined superhero conventions and re-introduced comics to an adult audience with a gripping, labyrinthine piece of comic art. Rorschach, a half-psychotic vigilante must convince his ex team-mates, now middle-aged and retired, that he has uncovered a plot to murder the remaining superheroes - along with millions of innocent civilians...Even reunited, will the remnants of the &#39;Watchmen&#39; be enough to avert a global apocalypse? With a powerful storyline masterfully told by comics supremo Alan Moore and beautifully rendered artwork by the talented Dave Gibbons - this is the one that started the graphic novel revolution and is definitely not one to miss!</p><p>Has any comic been as acclaimed as Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' <i>Watchmen</i>? Possibly only Frank Miller's <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>, but <i>Watchmen</i> remains the critics' favorite. Why? Because Moore is a better writer, and <i>Watchmen</i> a more complex and dark and literate creation than Miller's fantastic, subversive take on the Batman myth. Moore, renowned for many other of the genre's finest creations (<i>Saga of the Swamp Thing</i>, <i>V for Vendetta</i>, and <i>From Hell</i>, with Eddie Campbell) first put out <i>Watchmen</i> in 12 issues for DC in 1986-87. It won a comic award at the time (the 1987 Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards for Best Writer/Artist combination) and has continued to gather praise since.<p> The story concerns a group called the Crimebusters and a plot to kill and discredit them. Moore's characterization is as sophisticated as any novel's. Importantly the costumes do not get in the way of the storytelling; rather they allow Moore to investigate issues of power and control--indeed it was <i>Watchmen</i>, and to a lesser extent <i>Dark Knight</i>, that propelled the comic genre forward, making "adult" comics a reality. The artwork of Gibbons (best known for 2000AD's <i>Rogue Trooper</i> and DC's Green Lantern) is very fine too, echoing Moore's paranoid mood perfectly throughout. Packed with symbolism, some of the overlying themes (arms control, nuclear threat, vigilantes) have dated but the intelligent social and political commentary, the structure of the story itself, its intertextuality (chapters appended with excerpts from other "works" and "studies" on Moore's characters, or with excerpts from another comic book being read by a child within the story), the finepace of the writing and its humanity mean that <i>Watchmen</i> more than stands up--it keeps its crown as the best the genre has yet produced. <i>--Mark Thwaite</i> <br> <br> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Dave Gibbons on the Making of <i>Watchmen</i></strong> <br> </p><p> </p><p><b>Question:</b> You were tasked with drawing new illustrations of key shots from the new <i>Watchmen</i> film. Was it a difficult challenge to re-imagine your work in this movie format?</p> <p><b>Dave Gibbons:</b> I don&#x2019;t think that I actually did many key shots from the film. I had to actually imagine them rather than exactly recreate what was going to be in the movie. But as far as the drawings I did for the licensing purposes, accuracy was the real key so that they looked exactly like the movie. Whereas doing the graphic novel was creating stuff afresh and being very creative, this was more the case of interpreting something that already existed. So it was rather more a commercial art job than a creative thing.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How many scenes from the original graphic novel did you redraw in the new "movie" format?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> I kind of did them piecemeal, these licensing drawings. I did do a section of storyboarding for Zack Snyder. There is a part of the movie that isn&#x2019;t in the graphic novel and he wanted to see how I would have drawn it, if it had been in the graphic novel. So I redid the storyboards as three pages of comic on the nine-panel grid, also getting it coloured by John Higgins so it looked authentic. But I think there were probably only 3 or 4 scenes that I drew, which were from the movie.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was your working method for producing these new illustrations from the film? And how has it changed from when you originally illustrated <i>Watchmen</i>?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> When you&#x2019;re producing things from existing material, you have to look at and assemble the references... you know, keep looking backwards and forwards to make sure what you&#x2019;re drawing is accurate to what&#x2019;s in the photos. I did have lots of photos from the movie and in some cases I had more or less the illustration I was going to do in photo form, which made it a lot easier. On others I had to construct it from various references: really just the usual illustrator&#x2019;s job of drawing something to reference. And on the original illustrations of <i>Watchmen</i>, I was free to come up with exactly the angles and exactly the costumes and everything that I wanted to. When you&#x2019;ve designed a costume and drawn it a few times, you actually internalize it and you find you can draw it without having to refer to reference at all. So in some ways it&#x2019;s more creative and in some ways it&#x2019;s easier!</p> <p><b>Q:</b> In <i>Watchmen: The Art of the Film</i>, there are concept designs by other artists of their visions of your iconic characters. What do you think of their versions and did you offer any guidance while they were working on these?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> It&#x2019;s always really interesting to see versions of your characters drawn by other artists. You tend to see things in them that you hadn&#x2019;t noticed before. So I really enjoyed looking at those. I certainly didn&#x2019;t offer them any guidance. The purpose of getting those kinds of drawings done is to get a fresh perspective on what exists. I noticed actually that they really stuck more closely to my original designs than those, but I really enjoyed seeing them.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Watchmen: Portraits</i> is Clay Enos&#x2019;s stunning black and white collection of photos of each character from the <i>Watchmen</i> movie. What was it like looking through this book at all the characters you had conceived years ago now being brought to life by actors?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> It&#x2019;s rather interesting; you know if you look at the <i>Watching the Watchmen</i> book you can see these characters as fairly sketchy rough conceptual versions. Then when you look at Clay&#x2019;s book you can actually see them right down to counting the number of pores on the skin on the end of their noses! It&#x2019;s incredible high focus! It&#x2019;s like zooming in through space and time to look at the surface of some moon of Saturn or something. I thoroughly enjoyed his book... it had a real artistic quality to it that was really so good. And of course to see these actors who so much are the embodiment of what I drew, that it&#x2019;s a tremendous thrill to see them made flesh!</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Watchmen: The Film Companion</i> features some stills from the animated version of <i>The Black Freighter</i>. What do you think of the look and design of this animated feature? </p> <p><b>DG:</b> It looks really interesting! Although I drew my version in the comic book in a kind of horror-comic style, these are very much in a savage manga style. I think they work really well... they&#x2019;ve got the kind of manic intensity, which I think that work should have and I really can&#x2019;t wait to see the whole feature. I&#x2019;ve seen the trailer for it and that looks great and again they&#x2019;ve used a lot of the compositions that I came up with but just translated them to this kind of very modern drawn animation.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How much time did you spend on the set of <i>Watchmen</i>? Was it a surreal experience to see your work recreated like this?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> I was on the set of <i>Watchmen</i> for a couple of days and it really was surreal to walk through a door and then suddenly be in the presence of all these people in living breathing flesh! I was there for what you would call the Crimebusters meeting where they were all there in costume in the same room, which was incredible. They had obviously planned that so I would get to see everyone. It was surreal though quite a wonderful experience to see it come to life.</p>Alan Moore is perhaps the most acclaimed writer in the graphic story medium, having garnered countless awards for works such as WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, SWAMP THING and Miracleman. He is also the mastermind behind the America&#39;s Best Comics line, through which he has created (along with many talented illustrators) THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, PROMETHEA, TOM STRONG, TOMORROW STORIES and TOP TEN. As one of the medium&#39;s most important innovators since the early 1980s, Moore has influenced an entire generation of comics creators, and his work continues to inspire an ever-growing audience.</p><h2>The Unfinished Palazzo: Life, Love and Art in Venice: The Stories of Luisa Casati, Doris Castlerosse and Peggy Guggenheim</h2><p><p><strong>The story of Venice&#x2019;s &#x201c;Unfinished Palazzo&#x201d;&#x2015; told through the lives of three of its most unconventional, passionate, and fascinating residents: Luisa Casati, Doris Castlerosse, and Peggy Guggenheim</strong></p><p>Commissioned in 1750, the Palazzo Venier was planned as a testimony to the power and wealth of a great Venetian family, but the fortunes of the Veniers waned midconstruction and the project was abandoned. Empty, unfinished, and decaying, the building was considered an eyesore until the early twentieth century when it attracted and inspired three women at key moments in their lives: Luisa Casati, Doris Castlerosse, and Peggy Guggenheim.</p><p>Luisa Casati turned her home into an aesthete&#x2019;s fantasy where she hosted parties as extravagant and decadent as Renaissance court operas, spending small fortunes on her own costumes in her quest to become a &#x201c;living work of art&#x201d; and muse. Doris Castlerosse strove to make her mark in London and Venice during the glamorous, hedonistic interwar years, hosting film stars and royalty at glittering parties. In the postwar years, Peggy Gugenheim turned the Palazzo into a model of modernist simplicity that served as a home for her exquisite collection of modern art that today draws tourists and art lovers from around the world. Each vivid life story is accompanied by previously unseen materials from family archives, weaving an intricate history of these legendary art world eccentrics.</p> 69 illustrations</p><p>Judith Mackrell is a dance critic and author.&#x201c;<em>The Unfinished Palazzo</em> tells the stories of notoriously eccentric women: the Marchesa Luisa Casati, from Milan, a champion exhibitionist who considered her life (and especially her person) to be a work of art; Doris, Lady Castlerosse, an Englishwoman whose lovers included both Winston Churchill and his son, Randolph; and finally [Peggy] Guggenheim, the American art patron who bequeathed the mansion to her family's foundation as a museum of modern art. ... Their life stories are flashy, a kaleidoscope of bad marriages, bad divorces, Fortuny dresses, outlandish costume parties, fashionable portraits, excessive champagne, famous lovers, pickup lovers, alienated children and overlapping celebrity acquaintances. ... In more enlightened times these women might have had solid accomplishments...but Mackrell's documentation of their relentless self-absorption and unfiltered vanity argues against it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Skillfully weaves historical details into absorbing biographical profiles while also capturing the charm of Venice... Mackrell explores [the] eventful lives [of] three remarkable women [who] differed in many ways, but points out their similarities in motivation, independence, daring unconventionality, and historic roles in Venice and social culture. Her astute commentary is particularly illuminating, enlarging the reader's understanding of these individuals and the larger framework of their worlds. Well-chosen photographs and comprehensive notes and bibliography enhance the volume.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Thoughtful, gracefully written and engaging... Like Paris, Venice is a subject rife with clich�. Ms. Mackrell sidesteps this pitfall by focusing on one tiny part of the city. By book's end, the complexly fated, much-altered Venier comes to seem a mirror of its occupants.

Happily for his fans, he proves he can * SUNDAY EXPRESS * He offers an account of personal and political alienation, the tactics needed to contain terrorism, and the desirability or otherwise of deceit -- Natasha Cooper * TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT * taut, compulsive and hugely satisfying, with plenty to say about the limits of memory and the dangers of historical idealism.

Today, America&#x2019;s wars are everywhere and forever: our enemies change constantly and rarely wear uniforms, and virtually anything can become a weapon. As war expands, so does the role of the US military. Today, military personnel don&#x2019;t just &#x201c;kill people and break stuff.&#x201d; Instead, they analyze computer code, train Afghan judges, build Ebola isolation wards, eavesdrop on electronic communications, develop soap operas, and patrol for pirates. You name it, the military does it.<br> <br>Rosa Brooks traces this seismic shift in how America wages war from an unconventional perspective&#x2014;that of a former top Pentagon official who is the daughter of two anti-war protesters and a human rights activist married to an Army Green Beret. Her experiences lead her to an urgent warning: When the boundaries around war disappear, we risk destroying America&#x2019;s founding values and the laws and institutions we&#x2019;ve built&#x2014;and undermining the international rules and organizations that keep our world from sliding towards chaos. If Russia and China have recently grown bolder in their foreign adventures, it&#x2019;s no accident; US precedents have paved the way for the increasingly unconstrained use of military power by states around the globe. Meanwhile, we continue to pile new tasks onto the military, making it increasingly ill-prepared for the threats America will face in the years to come.<br> <br>By turns a memoir, a work of journalism, a scholarly exploration into history, anthropology and law, and a rallying cry, <i>How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything </i>transforms the familiar into the alien, showing us that the culture we inhabit is reshaping us in ways we may suspect, but don&#x2019;t really understand. It&#x2019;s the kind of book that will leave you moved, astonished, and profoundly disturbed, for the world around us is quietly changing beyond recognition&#x2014;and time is running out to make things right.</p><p>Rosa Brooks is a Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation, a columnist for <i>Foreign Policy</i>, and a law professor at Georgetown University<i>.</i> She previously worked at the Pentagon as Counselor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; in 2011, she was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service.

It took me weeks to shake off the slight feeling of unreality that hit me each time I entered the world&#x2019;s largest office building. Did I work here? How very strange.<br> <br>Everything about the Pentagon was strange. My mother, visiting me for lunch, gaped at the Pentagon&#x2019;s food courts, banks, and shops. &#x201c;The heart of American military power is a shopping mall?&#x201d; she asked. Once you got past the shops clustered by the Metro entrance, the Pentagon&#x2019;s corridors were endless and echoing, lined with closed metal doors flanked by keypads and stern printed warnings: &#x201c;No cell phones, cameras or other recording devices.&#x201d; Uniformed men and women strode about decisively, heels clicking on the shiny floors. The Pentagon had a unique scent too, some mix of cleaning fluids, wood polish, floor wax, coffee, and human stress, amplified by the canned air protecting its denizens from biological and chemical infiltration. Every time I walked in through the wide doors, the scent washed over me.<br> <br>The windows in the E Ring&#x2019;s outward-facing offices, which house many of the most senior officials, were made of a curious green glass. I never learned the details, but I assume the thick green glass was bulletproof, or blast proof, or surveillance proof, or all those things. Regardless, from within, the green glass gave an odd chartreuse tint to the world outside the Pentagon&#x2014;the endless acres of parking lots, the yacht basin, the Potomac River&#x2014;and beyond, the monuments and stately buildings of official Washington. Gazing through those windows, I felt like Dorothy in the Emerald City.<br> <br>There were peculiar exhibits everywhere: lurid paintings of fighter planes, elaborate dioramas illustrating the life of General Douglas MacArthur, glass-fronted displays of World War II code-breaking machines. The grand staircase leading up from the Pentagon&#x2019;s elegant River Entrance boasted a vast oil painting&#x2014;perhaps six feet by ten&#x2014;of a uniformed airman and his family kneeling at a chapel altar, rapt faces lit from above by a shaft of sunlight coming through a stained-glass window. In case the viewer was particularly obtuse, the inscription beneath the painting clarified the message: &#x201c;And the Lord God asked, &#x2018;Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?&#x2019; And the reply came back: &#x2018;Here I am, send me.&#x2019; &#x201d; Kitsch&#x2014;but sanctified kitsch.<br> Ahoy, Matey!<p></p> <br>When I first started work at the Pentagon, it seemed that I had walked into some kind of permanent Talk Like a Pirate Week. Meetings opened with cries of &#x201c;Ahoy, matey!,&#x201d; &#x201c;Avast, me hearties!,&#x201d; and merry threats to make latecomers walk the plank. Occasionally, you even saw someone sporting a black eye patch or a rakish bandana.<br> <br>Whatever I had expected about my new job at the heart of American military power, it wasn&#x2019;t this. But on April 8, 2009&#x2014;less than a week before I started my new job in the Office of the Secretary of Defense&#x2014;four young Somali pirates had boarded the merchant vessel Maersk Alabama, making it the first U.S.-flagged ship to be seized by pirates in nearly two hundred years. They demanded ransom money, but on April 12, Navy SEAL snipers shot and killed three of the pirates, rescuing Richard Phillips, the Maersk Alabama&#x2019;s American captain, and capturing the fourth pirate.<br> <br>The very next day, I started work at the Pentagon, surrounded by giddy military bureaucrats cracking pirate jokes.<br> <br>And it was funny&#x2014;sort of. Pirates! Who&#x2019;da thunk it? And who could blame hardworking Pentagon action officers for uttering some celebratory cries of &#x201c;Avast, me hearties&#x201d;? For years, the Pentagon had struggled through the bloody and inconclusive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. After a decade of suicide bombs and dead civilians, how nice to have an uncomplicated success story. How nice to be the good guys, rescuing American citizens and ships from the bad guys.<br> He Caught a Big Fish<p></p> <br>Admittedly, it wasn&#x2019;t exactly a fair fight: the four Somali pirates were scruffy, undernourished teenage boys. They were poor and untrained: the sole pirate to survive his encounter with the SEALs was Abdiwali Abdiqadir Muse, the oldest of twelve children from a Puntland family that got by on a few dollars a day. Muse grew up in a one-room home. His mother sold milk at the market; his father herded goats and camels.1 Interviewed after their rescue, members of the Maersk Alabama&#x2019;s crew recalled Muse&#x2019;s astonished delight at discovering he had unwittingly gained control of an American ship: &#x201c;He kept asking, `You all come from America?&#x2019; Then he claps and cheers and smiles. He caught himself a big fish.&#x201d;2<br> <br>The fish was much too big for Muse, a scrawny kid of 5'2". His family told journalists that he was only sixteen, and had been duped by older criminals into trying his hand at piracy.3 But he had no birth certificate (few Somalis do), and after a medical examination, U.S. authorities asserted that he was probably nineteen rather than sixteen. Either way, Muse and his dreams of a hefty ransom bonanza were no match for U.S. Navy SEALs.<br> <br>Notwithstanding the jokes, the Navy assault on the Maersk Alabama pirates was in many ways a typical twenty-first-century military engagement. U.S. forces increasingly find themselves fighting nontraditional enemies: pirates, terrorists, insurgents, organized crime networks, and other actors who pose asymmetric challenges to conventional U.S. military power. Today, America&#x2019;s adversaries rarely engage in battles over territorial control. They&#x2019;d be fools to do so, given conventional U.S. military dominance. Instead, they use kidnapping, hijacking, sabotage, theft, propaganda videos, computer hacking, suicide bombs, and IEDs to cause disruption and damage to U.S. interests.<br> <br>Sometimes America&#x2019;s adversaries have the overt or covert backing of foreign states; sometimes they are nonstate groups acting alone. Sometimes their motives are ideological or political; sometimes purely financial. The threats they pose are real, but difficult to quantify or categorize and still more difficult to combat. You can &#x201c;win&#x201d; a war against Nazi Germany, but how do you win against shifting, inchoate extremist networks with little interest in controlling physical terrain, or roving bands of hungry young African pirates seeking ransom money?<br> <br>No one at the Pentagon was quite sure, but Congress, galvanized by the Maersk Alabama incident, was demanding answers&#x2014;and my boss, Mich�le Flournoy, was supposed to provide them. In the absence of a designated speechwriter, she turned to me to draft her testimony.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Although I had worked at the State Department, I had no experience on Capitol Hill, and at that point I had never drafted nor given congressional testimony. But I was an international law scholar, and knew something about the intertwined history of piracy and international law. For sure, I thought, Congress would want to know about this too.<br> <br>So my draft testimony began with a capsule history of piracy and law, cribbed in part from prior testimony by other DoD officials and embellished with some quick Googling:<br> <br>Mr. Chairman, piracy is a growing problem, but not a new problem. Since humans first began to travel and move valuables by ship, there have been pirates. In Roman times, Julius Caesar himself was seized by pirates in 75 B.C., and released after ransom was paid. The Vikings, too, were notorious pirates. Historically, the line between piracy and legitimate use of force on the high seas was often blurry; many states&#x2014;including our own&#x2014;at times issued letters of marque and reprisal, authorizing &#x201c;privateers&#x201d; to attack an enemy&#x2019;s merchant ships. The Barbary States of North Africa were particularly entrepreneurial issuers of letters of marque, and by 1800, the young United States was paying about 20% of total federal revenues to the Barbary States, as ransom and tribute.4<br> <br>International efforts to combat piracy also have an ancient pedigree. Since Roman times, pirates have been deemed hostes humani generis: the enemies of all humankind, and as a matter of customary international law, piracy was a crime of &#x201c;universal jurisdiction,&#x201d; meaning that every state had the right and the duty to capture and prosecute piracy on the high seas, even if its own ships or nationals were not involved.<br> <br>In the middle of the 19th century, the major European powers signed the Declaration of Paris, agreeing to end the practice of issuing letters of marque and reprisal. The United States, though not a signatory to the Declaration, agreed to abide by its principles. Most other states did so as well. As the anti-piracy and anti-privateering principles of the Declaration of Paris were gradually incorporated into successive treaties on the law of the sea, the long era of state-sponsored piracy came more or less to a close.<br> <br>I handed this to Mich�le, who read through it quickly. &#x201c;This is really, ah, interesting,&#x201d; she finally said. &#x201c;But I think we should skip the historical part. I don&#x2019;t think the Senate Armed Services Committee is going to want to focus on that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went back to the drawing board.<br> <br>Getting the testimony just right proved harder than I had thought: the trick, it turned out, was to offer a little something to everyone on the committee, with enough caveats to avoid committing the Defense Department to anything that might come back to bite us. Here, we had a dual challenge: convincing any congressional skeptics that it was, in fact, entirely appropriate for the Defense Department to put resources into fighting a bunch of scruffy teen pirates (rather than solely into, say, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan), while at the same time convincing any counterpiracy hawks that no, the entire U.S. Navy could not be sent indefinitely to patrol the Somali coastline. In the end, I came up with this:<br> <br>Mr. Chairman, we are currently seeing a dramatic upswing in reported pirate attacks, particularly off the coast of Somalia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Freedom of the seas is critical to our national security and international commerce, and it is also a core principle of international law.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From a Department of Defense perspective, our strategic goals with regard to Somali piracy include deterrence, disruption/interdiction, and prosecution. But achieving these goals will be challenging for several reasons.<br> <br>First, the geographic area affected is vast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When not actively engaged in piracy, pirate vessels easily blend in with ordinary shipping.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Second, the root causes of Somali piracy lie in the poverty and instability that continue to plague that troubled country. Third, serious gaps remain in the international community&#x2019;s ability to create an effective legal deterrent by prosecuting pirates for their crimes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fourth and finally, many in the merchant shipping industry continue to unrealistically assume that military forces will always be present to intervene if pirates attack. As a result, many have so far been unwilling to invest in the basic security measures that would render their ships far less vulnerable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Although Somali piracy currently appears to be motivated solely by money, not ideology, and we see no meaningful links between Somali pirates and violent extremist groups, we must ensure that piracy does not evolve into a future funding source for terrorism.<br> <br>Most of this draft survived. We went on to offer up a range of DoD responses to piracy: we promised that we would be &#x201c;working closely with other Agencies and Departments to develop comprehensive regional counter-piracy strategies,&#x201d; &#x201c;working directly with merchant shipping lines to undertake vulnerability assessments and disseminate best practices,&#x201d; working &#x201c;with allies and regional states to develop their capacity to patrol the seas and protect their own shipping,&#x201d; and continuing &#x201c;to address the root causes of most regional piracy: the ongoing poverty and instability in Somalia.&#x201d;<br> <br>What the testimony didn&#x2019;t do&#x2014;and couldn&#x2019;t do&#x2014;was resolve the core underlying questions: Is the twenty-first-century U.S. military the right institution to take on ragtag bands of impoverished Africans preying on private shipping? Which U.S. institution was going to address Somalia&#x2019;s &#x201c;ongoing poverty and instability&#x201d;? At what price?&#x2014;and what would constitute &#x201c;success&#x201d;? What rules should govern military counterpiracy operations, and how should we conceptualize them? Were they &#x201c;war&#x201d;? Law enforcement? Both? Something else altogether?<br> Global Counterpiracy<p></p> <br>Today, these questions remain unanswered, but the U.S. military continues to play an expansive role in global counterpiracy operations. Navy ships patrol the waters off the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, and the number and locations of Navy patrols change in response to shifting patterns of piracy. For the most part, these patrols occur in the context of multinational counterpiracy efforts: the United States participates in Combined Task Force 151: Counter-Piracy with states ranging from Turkey and Pakistan to South Korea and Australia; and in Operation Ocean Shield with other NATO states.5 These counterpiracy patrols play a preventive role and also have a quick response capability of the sort used in the Maersk Alabama rescue.<br> <br>Many U.S. military counterpiracy efforts are more indirect, focusing less on military action and more on building the capacity of partner governments to effectively patrol their own coastlines. Through a maritime security exercise called Obangame Express, for instance, U.S. forces have helped train the navies and coast guards of Gulf of Guinea nations to conduct boarding operations.6 Other U.S. military initiatives focus on providing African states with improved sensing and communications networks to enable better tracking of coastal areas. In Nigeria and Djibouti, the U.S. Navy has funded new multimillion-dollar radar systems that use &#x201c;an automatic identification system and ground-based radar and sensors to enhance awareness of maritime traffic.&#x201d;7 The U.S. military donates ships to partner nations and provides training in everything from boarding techniques to &#x201c;small boat maintenance.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s not all. The military also supports counterpiracy strategic communication programs on Somali radio stations and develops training manuals to help local law enforcement officials conduct counterpiracy investigations.8<br> <br>The effectiveness of these efforts is difficult to judge. On the one hand, piracy off the Somali Coast has dropped sharply in the last couple of years, and it seems reasonable to attribute the decline to stepped-up multinational counterpiracy programs, with the United States playing a leading role. On the other hand, piracy is up sharply on the other side of the African continent, where attacks on shipping in the Gulf of Guinea have become both more frequent and more lethal.9 It&#x2019;s hard to determine causation: Is Somali piracy down because of U.S. military activity, or because of slightly improved stability and economic opportunities in Somalia? And if Somalia is more stable today, is that because of U.S. assistance, or internal factors unrelated to the United States?<br> <br>Some analysts also question whether the decline in Somali piracy will be enduring,10 noting that although there have been fewer attacks overall, those that have occurred have been more sophisticated and successful. It may be, they argue, that improved counterpiracy methods just motivate pirates to develop more sophisticated piracy meth...</p><h2>Vitamin B-17 Forbidden Weapon Against Cancer: The Fight for Laetrile</h2><p>1 HARDCOVER BOOK WITH DUST COVER</p><p></p><h2>Requiem: A Hallucination</h2><p><p><strong>A private meeting, chance encounters, and a mysterious tour of Lisbon, in this brilliant homage to Fernando Pessoa.</strong></p><p>In this enchanting and evocative novel, Antonio Tabucchi takes the reader on a dream-like trip to Portugal, a country he is deeply attached to.

The unnamed narrator - clearly a persona of Tabucchi himself - awaits a midnight appointment on a quay of the Tagus. His time is filled with a succession of encounters with residents of the Portuguese capital, and with late friends and relations. Part travelog, part autobiography, part fiction, Requiem at once becomes a homage to a country and a people and a farewell to the past; requiescat in pace. In all this, the narrator himself remains shadowy, walking in a dream atmosphere. The midnight appointment approaches. The narrator meets at last with another unnamed writer, now long dead, though the evidence points to the great poet Fernando Pessoa. Requiem thus ends as an act of succession, the narrator&#39;s claim to a literary forebear who, like himself, is of evasive and manifold personalities.<p><strong>Antonio Tabucchi&nbsp;</strong>was born in Pisa in 1943 and died in Lisbon, his adopted home, in 2012.

Some were exalted in the public eye, others known only to his intimates. In this bold, revisionist portrait, Robert L. O&#x2019;Connell captures the man in full for the first time. From his early exploits in Florida, through his brilliant but tempestuous generalship during the Civil War, to his postwar career as a key player in the building of the transcontinental railroad, Sherman was, as O&#x2019;Connell puts it, the &#x201c;human embodiment of Manifest Destiny.&#x201d; Here is Sherman the military strategist, a master of logistics with an uncanny grasp of terrain and brilliant sense of timing. Then there is &#x201c;Uncle Billy,&#x201d; Sherman&#x2019;s public persona, a charismatic hero to his troops and quotable catnip to the newspaper writers of his day. Here, too, is the private Sherman, whose appetite for women, parties, and the high life of the New York theater complicated his already turbulent marriage. Warrior, family man, American icon, William Tecumseh Sherman has finally found a biographer worthy of his protean gifts. A masterful character study whose myriad insights are leavened with its author&#x2019;s trademark wit, <i>Fierce Patriot</i> will stand as the essential book on Sherman for decades to come.<br><br><b>Praise for<i> Fierce Patriot</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A superb examination of the many facets of the iconic Union general.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;General David Petraeus </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sherman&#x2019;s standing in American history is formidable. . . .

O&#x2019;Connell</b> received a Ph.D. in history at the University of Virginia, and spent thirty years as a senior analyst at the National Ground Intelligence Center. He is presently a visiting professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, and was a contributing editor to <i>MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History</i>. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Ghosts of Cannae: Hannibal and the Darkest Hour of the Roman Republic; Of Arms and Men: A History of War, Weapons, and Aggression; </i>and<i> Soul of the Sword: An Illustrated History of Weaponry and Warfare from Prehistory to the Present</i>.Part I<br><br>The Military Strategist<br><br>Chapter I<br><br>Tyro<br><br>1<br><br>On June 12, 1836, a Hudson River steamer nosed into the dock at West Point and deposited, among others, sixteen-year-old William Tecumseh Sherman. As he stared up at the bluffs upon which sat the United States Military Academy, it&#x2019;s a safe bet that young Sherman had only a glimmer of what he was getting into. He knew the place was strict and &#x201c;the army was its natural consequence,&#x201d; but what that implied would have escaped him&#x2014;that he was beginning a process that would induct him into a warrior elite, forging bonds that would last a lifetime.<br><br>Admission was not assured. Because appointment to West Point was open to young men from all classes in a nation of wildly variable primary education, an entrance exam, testing for literacy and arithmetic skills, was administered upon arrival.1 For Sherman, this amounted to a formality. His foster father, the powerful Whig politician Thomas Ewing, had not only engineered his appointment, but also ensured his charge was academically prepared. Although the family base in Lancaster, Ohio, remained less than a generation removed from the frontier, the boy had been rigorously schooled and apparently knew enough to bone up on French and math, exactly the subjects that would be stressed plebe year.2 Not surprisingly, he aced the test and academically, at least, never looked back.<br><br>Ever gregarious, he fit in easily with his fellow cadets. In particular, he forged what would prove to be lifelong bonds with his two roommates, Stewart Van Vliet and George Thomas. Thomas, who would gain fame in the Civil War as the &#x201c;Rock of Chickamauga,&#x201d; became a vital and continuing presence in Sherman&#x2019;s career. Even as a veritable pebble, Thomas was already formidable, at one point threatening to throw an upperclassman out the window if he didn&#x2019;t cease his attempts to haze them.3 Sherman himself was less physical, but he must have appreciated his roommate&#x2019;s bravado and marked him as someone who would not back down in a tough situation. Still, such outbursts were best kept hushed and infrequent at West Point.<br><br>Cadets were subjected to a relentless system of regulation, observation, and meticulous evaluation. Their long days were consumed with a monotonous string of planned activities, most of them arduous and all, it seems, subject to some kind of sanction. The system was the masterpiece of Sylvanus Thayer, whose short but indelible tenure as superintendent set the academy irrevocably on the course of &#x201c;appraisal by numbers,&#x201d; based on the assumption that cadets could be usefully ranked according to a precise order of merit (or demerit, really).<br><br>The keystone was the academic program, administered by faculty set in place by Thayer and led by the brilliant but peevish professor Dennis Hart Mahan.4 It has been said that Thayer effectively turned West Point into an engineering school, but this can be seen as serendipitous, the result of a math-heavy curriculum, which not coincidentally proved useful in rating and weeding out cadets.5 Sherman and his fellows were graded daily in all subjects, the results of which were tabulated with exam scores and fed into a complicated formula that included dress and disciplinary infractions. This produced an annual and ultimately final class rank used to assign graduates to the various service branches&#x2014;the Corps of Engineers receiving those standing at the front of the long gray line, followed by artillery, cavalry, and then infantry.<br><br>Because at West Point everything counted and everything was counted, the system was also applied to a series of upper-class courses, including topography, geography, chemistry, physics, rhetoric, political philosophy, and drawing&#x2014;a two-year requirement presumed useful in creating maps.6 Sherman proved particularly adept at capturing images&#x2014;his teacher Robert W. Weir was an accomplished painter of the Hudson River school&#x2014;but rather than any real artistic talent, this probably reflected an eidetic or photographic memory, especially for terrain, which proved to be one of Sherman&#x2019;s core military talents.7 At any rate, he prospered academically, maintaining himself near the top of his class of around forty-five survivors of the seventy or so who entered with him&#x2014;though his disdain for spit and polish lowered his final standing enough to preclude entry into the elite engineers.<br><br>Meanwhile, he may have noticed that with the exception of Mahan&#x2019;s capstone Science of War course in his final year, there was little that was specifically military about the academic diet fed to those supposedly preparing for careers as professional soldiers. Even Mahan went heavy on the military engineering and light on strategy, relying on the writings of French general Antoine-Henri Jomini to implant an almost exclusively Napoleonic view of warfare in his young charges (who, if the past was any indication, would probably spend most of their time fighting Indians).8<br><br>This sort of disconnect raises questions as to West Point&#x2019;s actual mission. Sherman arrived at the crest of the age of Jackson, a high tide of egalitarian and democratic enthusiasm. Old Hickory was undeniably a general, but military elites and the kinds of schools that bred them were viewed with suspicion.9 West Point&#x2019;s survival depended upon accommodation, and by offering a free college education that stressed engineering-friendly subjects to boys of all classes, the academy undoubtedly provided a service to a developing nation much in need of infrastructure.<br><br>It was understood that many cadets would not pursue careers as officers much beyond graduation but would turn instead to civilian pursuits. &#x201c;I tell you Coz,&#x201d; wrote Cadet Ulysses S. Grant, &#x201c;if a man graduates from here he is set fer life, come what may.&#x201d;10 Still, the Civil War would offer Grant a much better fit for the skill set he picked up at West Point than his prewar clerkship at his father&#x2019;s store. So too with Sherman, Henry Halleck, and George McClellan, key luminaries of the great struggle, who would briefly leave the service, only to return to what proved to be their true calling. Today&#x2019;s notion that West Point was essentially dedicated to producing &#x201c;engineers who could also function as soldiers rather than the reverse&#x201d;11 would have seemed odd indeed to these men. Just about everything cadets experienced at West Point was militarily derived or motivated.<br><br>A case in point is drill, the training that teaches soldiers to move together. Plebe Sherman was thrilled at first sight of the old cadets &#x201c;stepping as one man&#x2014;all forming a line&#x201d;; suddenly, he wrote his foster brother Hugh, he understood what West Point was all about.12 He would have plenty of opportunity to confirm the observation. Cadets marched and drilled daily, sometimes with a rigor and intensity that caused a number to faint.<br><br>This was no casual pursuit. Ever since Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, had pioneered these routines in the Netherlands at the end of the sixteenth century, they had formed the basis of firefighting tactics. The explanation lay with the weapon everybody used, the single-shot, muzzle-loading, smoothbore musket, which also had not changed fundamentally over this time. Because bullets bounced up their barrels, the accurate range of these guns did not exceed around eighty yards, enabling combat formations to blast away at each other out in the open in relative proximity. Thus the key lay not in aiming, but in loading and firing as fast as possible, using a complicated series of motions first analyzed and regularized by Maurice and then drilled relentlessly into subsequent generations of infantrymen so they might be performed reliably and automatically in the chaos and terror of battle.<br><br>Maximum firepower also demanded that soldiers do their shooting in long thin lines only several ranks thick. Firing lines, however, were not only brittle, but incapable of rapid and precise maneuver. This required short, thick columns, which moved much faster but were also more vulnerable since the men were bunched together. Safety, or at least relative safety, lay in the rapid and orderly transition from column to line and the reverse, which in turn demanded the disciplined movement of smaller combat units&#x2014;in the case of the Corps of Cadets, four companies, subdivided into platoons and sections. Whether on the parade ground of West Point or on an actual battlefield, choreographing all these elements so they didn&#x2019;t collide or otherwise fall apart required almost endless practice, men marching at exactly the same pace with exactly the same stride almost ad infinitum, turning into metronomes, at least until they stopped and became loading machines.<br><br>Cadet Sherman soon grew bored with the ponderous evolutions of infantry tactics, but otherwise he said very little about them.13 No wonder. They were by intent mind-numbing. Frederick the Great probably had the last word on the subject: &#x201c;I come from drill. I drill. I will drill&#x2014;that is all the news I can give you.&#x201d;14 Yet there was a great deal more to be learned on the parade ground than Sherman probably realized, subtle lessons but pervasive ones.<br><br>Courage had changed since the gun proliferated. Earlier, heroism had consisted of close fighting, hand to hand, and battle, especially in the Western military tradition, was understood to be a matter of intimate confrontation. But a hail of supersonic projectiles had eventually rendered this standard pretty much suicidal. As a compromise, fighting formations backed off, and bravery became largely a matter of standing fast and ignoring the bullets.<br><br>Among officers, this meant keeping a cool head and focusing on directing the fighting. Within the ranks, it consisted of a routinized determination to faithfully execute a series of movements drummed in by endless practice. To harness this kind of human energy, to use it effectively, leaders needed to grasp its repetitive power. So it made sense to give cadets the same experience. And as they drilled, Sherman and his cohort would have found themselves growing together, enlisting what historian William McNeill believes to be the primal penchant for dance&#x2014;shared patterns of movement performed in unison, stirring a deep sense of corporate identity.15 Individual cadets bonded into a whole, exactly the message the academy wanted to impart.<br><br>Still, the entire enterprise was by its nature dehumanizing and fostered the notion that soldiers (to officers of the day, this generally meant long-term enlistees, or regulars) were basically expendable, things to be dressed up, marched around, and shot. In part, this was a function of the necessities of organized warfare itself, but it also reflected the aristocratic origins of firefighting as it had evolved in Europe. &#x201c;The army,&#x201d; in the words of the eighteenth-century courtier Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, &#x201c;must inevitably consist of the scum of the people. . . . We must therefore rely on military discipline to purify and mold the mass of corruption and turn it into something useful.&#x201d;16 While Sherman and his classmates might not have put it so bluntly, the comment basically characterized the outlook they took away from the parade ground.<br><br>This is important, because one day they would come to command men who thought themselves as good as any other, who believed officers ought to be elected, and who, when they got new guns that made fighting in the open a great deal more dangerous, tended to take matters into their own hands. Some, like Sherman, reacted appropriately, others less so. But it is in this clash of outlooks that much of the combat history of the American Civil War is to be found.<br><br>Those arguing that West Point was more civilian than military could always point to the professorial confab who controlled the core curriculum, only one of whom had ever seen combat or even been on active duty for more than a few years.17 Beyond the lecture hall, a number were prominently published in their fields, none more so than Mahan, whose knowledge of Jomini was widely equated with strategic wisdom. Plainly these were academics, not soldiers.<br><br>Yet they were also not alone on the faculty. The Thayer system dictated that each senior faculty member be supported by section instructors, young officers who saw the cadets daily and on a more personal basis, in the barracks as well as the classroom. They were brought in on rotation from all over the regular army and were consistently among the best and brightest.18 Of the Civil War generation, George McClellan, William Hardee, Robert Anderson, John Schofield, Oliver O. Howard, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Fitz-John Porter, and William Rosecrans all served as &#x201c;schoolmasters&#x201d; at West Point. This was important duty.<br><br>Yet as with drill, its most lasting impact was probably more subtle and psychological than formal and academic. In effect, these young lieutenants and captains were the cadets&#x2019; umbilical cord to the real world of the U.S. Army. They ran the summer encampment where cadets were taught the practical aspects of service&#x2014;how to set up a camp, post a picket, run a skirmish line, fire an artillery piece, even wield a sword and ride a horse if they didn&#x2019;t know already. More important, they learned by example&#x2014;the way these young officers looked and acted would have been the way cadets wanted to look and act.<br><br>These were role models and future commanders, and the cadets would have hung on their words in ways that eluded the senior faculty. These men could describe what it was like to command a lonely outpost, recount the splendors of a largely unoccupied continent, and, of course, tell war stories. Since a soldier on the frontier could expect combat every five years, there would have been plenty to tell. This is where West Point&#x2019;s supposed gap in Indian removal instruction would have been filled: these men were the academy&#x2019;s voice of practical wisdom on the nature of irregular warfare. Sherman and his classmates would adapt quickly to their first assignment, the Second Seminole War, in part because they had been told what to expect. Quietly, though.<br><br>Cadets also learned from one another, mostly from the inevitable process of sizing up and sorting out status. A pack of high-spirited late adolescents, living in close quarters, constrained on every side by a tyrannical behavioral model, brought out a lot of interesting behavior. Sherman himself cruised through most of it unperturbed, making friends but no apparent enemies. Already something of a newspaper junkie, he had a subscription to the National Gazette, which he loaned out freely.19 He was respected but low-key, choosing to abstain from involvement with the Point&#x2019;s most obvious pecking order.<br><br>Cadet rank (&#x201c;captains&#x201d; and &#x201c;lieutenants&#x201d; from the first class, &#x201c;sergeants&#x201d; from the second, and &#x201c;corporals&#x201d; from the third) was West Point&#x2019;s official standard of prestige. These positions were reserved for the spotless cadets, individuals of high academic standing who were also unsullied by demerits. But the academy&#x2019;s version of success and subsequent military success did not necessarily coincide. Using the example of Henry Halleck and George McClellan, you might even say that an obsessive following of the rules actually inhibited fighting initiative and opportunism. Of course, no cadet was more spotless than Robert E. Lee, accumulating no demerits in four years, and on the battlefield nothing slowed him down.</p><h2>Another Hive of Bees</h2><p>Stories that help build character.

There is a plot (of sorts), one of revenge surrounding a doctor who, in removing a bone spur from our narrator, manages to amputate a ring and index finger, a significant surgical error considering that the narrator is, or was, a violinist. When Dr. Roak is released from prison, our narrator escapes in order to begin the pursuit, and thus begins a digressive journey from Afghanistan to Venice, then on to India and Morocco and France. All of this takes place amid Mathews&#39;s fictional concern and play with games, puzzles, arcana, and stories within stories.</p><p>Born in New York in 1930, Harry Mathews settled in Europe in 1952 and has since then lived in Spain, Germany, Italy, and (chiefly) France. When Mathews published his first poems in 1956, he was associated with the so-called New York School of poets, with three of whom (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, and James Schuyler) he founded the review Locus Solus in 1961. Through his friendship with Georges Perec, he became a member of the Oulipo in 1972. The author of six novels and several collections of poetry, recent publications are THE NEW TOURISM (Sand Paper Press, 2010), Sainte Catherine, a novella written in French (Editions P.O.L, 2000), The Human Country: the Collected Short Stories (Dalkey Archive Press, 2002), The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collected Essays (Dalkey Archive Press, 2003), OULIPO COMPENDIUM (co-edited with Alastair Brotchie; Atlas Press and Make Now Press, 2005), and My Life in CIA: A Chronicle of 1973 (Dalkey Archive Press, 2005).From Part 1-A Disappointing Inning: Mannish Madame Nevtaya slowly cried "Fur bowls!" and the Fideist batter, alert to the sense behind the sound of her words, jogged toward first base. The wind from the northern steppe blew coldly on the close of our season. <p>The Fideist division received the camp's worst villains, and its team assembled their dregs. Among us Defective Baptists a love of baseball signified gentleness; among Fideists, cruelty. Consider their bloodthirsty team-- </p><p>Left field: undertaker's assistant and caterer to necrophiles, Sydney Valsalva kidnaped infants for beheading. </p><p>Center field: Lynn Petomi, dentist, mutilated the mouths of patients. </p><p>Pitcher: Hilary Cheyne-Stokes, gynecologist, committed analagous crimes. </p><p>1st base: Tommy Withering, osteopath, flayed a younger brother. </p><p>Shortstop: Evelyn Roak, surgeon, supplied human fragments to a delicatessen and was arrested for scandalous amputations.* </p><p>(2nd base: Cecil Meli, nurse, had been jailed by mistake.) </p><p>Right field: Lee Donders, grocer, transformed Roak's material into "Donders' Delicacies." </p><p>Catcher: Marion Gullstrand, obstetrician, tortured unwed mothers. </p><p>3rd base: Leslie Auenbrugger, psychiatrist--the "Restroom Bomber." </p><p>Valsalva had walked. Since I was catcher, I went out to the mound to say a few words of encouragement. The second batter grounded to shortstop, forcing Valsalva; the third struck out; and the Fideists' turn at bat would have ended with Withering's high foul if, failing to allow for the wind, I had not misjudged it. Withering singled on the next pitch. </p><p>I was thus obliged to execute my plan in the first inning of the game. Having foreseen the possibility, I drew a prepared ball from my chest protector to substitute it for the one in play. </p><p>I had made the ball myself. It was built around two unusual parts--a tiny battery and a pellet of dynamite. From each of the battery's outlets, a wire extended through the hair stuffing of the ball about halfway to the leather wrapper. The free ends of the wires, one of which passed through a firing cap fixed to the dynamite, were six millimeters apart, enough to prevent their junction at a mild impact but not at a sufficiently hard one. The difference, which I had determined exactly, was that between a fast pitch caught and a slow pitch hit. The wire ends separated into meshing sprays of filament, so that no matter how the ball was struck, it was certain to explode. </p><p>To shield myself, I had reinforced my equipment with layers of nylon in the chest protector, steel in the cap and shin guards, and a lucite screen in the mask. </p><p>For the umpire's protection I counted on her thick skin. </p><p>I expected the explosion to create general confusion, stun and knock down the batter, and explain the batter's death. The bomb itself would kill no one, but I had concealed in my right shin guard, ready to use as soon as the ball had been detonated, a hypodermic of botulin. </p><p>Evelyn Roak stood at the plate. To my dismay, the first three pitches were low--the pitcher later complained that the ball was heavy. The fourth was a perfect strike, and my hopes revived. At the next delivery the batter drew back to swing, but the pitch was wild. The ball sailed past my outstretched glove as I lunged at it, skittered over the ground behind home plate, off the playing field altogether, at last disappearing irretrievably, and with an abysmal liquid reverberation, into a drain. *For example, removing, together with a troublesome spur of bone, the index and ring fingers of my left hand. I was then a violinist.</p></p><h2>Seesaw Girl</h2><p>Jade never ventures beyond the walls of her family&#39;s Inner Court; in seventeenth-century Korea, a girl of good family does not leave home until she marries.

Once derided by the art world, artists such as Vladimir Tretchikoff, creator of The Green Lady, and Margaret Keane, whose portraits launched the Big Eye movement, are today emerging from anonymity to be reassessed as pop art geniuses. Wayne Hemingway, one of Britain's leading street fashion designers, explains his long-held fascination with the genre in a concise, witty text that runs alongside over 300 gems from his own collection. He sketches the lives of the leading artists and reviews their new-found acclaim in the world of fashion, fine art and photography today. <p>"I think what Keane has done is just terrific.

Author Wayne Hemingway makes a heartfelt case for the cultural importance of these paintings. Using the example of his own grandmother, a collector, Hemingway discusses the significance of mass-market art for the middle and working classes and compares it to the rest of the art market.<p> According to Hemingway, Vladimir Tretchikoff, famous for his paintings and posters of mysterious ethnic women, "achieved everything that Andy Warhol stated he wanted to do but could never achieve because of his coolness." A huge phenomenon for the past 40 years has been portraits of crying and big-eyed children. The most famous creator of these iconic images is San Francisco artist Margaret Keane. Her exaggerated style became known as "Keane-eyes." Hemingway traces the influence of Keane through movies, fashion, and famous collectors, noting that movie director Tim Burton commissioned Keane to paint a portrait of his girlfriend Lisa Marie. This book is a personal and focused look at the 1960s generation of mass-market art. It includes pullout posters of some of the famous paintings and features a fuzzy mock wallpaper cover. <i>--J.P.

Too grand to keep a record of his own movements, he was well-served by his chaplain and amanuensis, Antonio de Beatis, who day by day kept a steadily enthusiastic record of the scenes they passed amongst. The range of de Beatis&#39;s interests was quite remarkably wide. His descriptions of individuals, landscapes, towns, of whole regions and the characters and customs of their inhabitants, of churches, palaces, relics and works of art provide one of the clearest impressions we have of the physical quality of life in north-western Europe in the Renaissance. This range owes something to the company he kept. Without the Cardinal he would not have had the organs played in the churches they visited, would not have watched Raphael&#39;s tapestries being woven in Brussels or met Leonardo da Vinci at Amboise. But it owes still more to the traditions which by 1517 suggested not only what a curious traveller should look at but the way in which he might organise his impressions, and express them in writing. For this reason most of the editor&#39;s Introduction is devoted to providing a pioneering account of the evolution of the Renaissance travel journal. Though the Italian text published in the German edition of Ludwig Pastor in 1905 has been frequently quoted by political, social and art historians, the Journal has not previously been translated into English.</p><p>J.R.

He grew up in Brooklyn where he went to grammar school and at the age of eight he gained his citizen papers. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He then went on to Columbia University and resolved to become a chemist rather than follow the medical career his father had in mind for him. He graduated in chemistry and after a short spell in the Army he gained his doctorate in 1949 and qualified as an instructor in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine where he became Associate Professor in 1955, doing research in nucleic acid. Increasingly, however, the pressures of chemical research conflicted with his aspirations in the literary field, and in 1958 he retired to full-time authorship while retaining his connection with the University. Asimov&#39;s fantastic career as a science fiction writer began in 1939 with the appearance of a short story, `Marooned Off Vesta&#39;, in Amazing Stories. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the leading SF magazines of the day including Astounding, Astonishing Stories, Super Science Stories and Galaxy. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. With nearly five hundred books to his credit and several hundred articles, Asimov&#39;s output was prolific by any standards. Apart from his many world-famous science fiction works, Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mystery stories, a four-volume History of North America, a two-volume Guide to the Bible, a biographical dictionary, encyclopaedias, textbooks and an impressive list of books on many aspects of science, as well as two volumes of autobiography. Isaac Asimov died in 1992 at the age of 72.</p><h2>The Tomten and the Fox / Raven och Tomten</h2><p>A sequel to the well-loved <b>Tomten</b>. In this story, adapted from the Swedish tale by Astrid Lindgren, the sly fox sneaks toward the farm in the moonlight, hoping to steal a chicken or two. But he&#x2019;s forgotten that the old Tomten guards the farm at night.

The Tomten, who looks after the farm at night, meets a hungry fox and agrees to share his supper with him if the fox promises to leave the hens alone. A very gentle, friendly story. It is refreshing that he understands that the fox is hungry and needs to eat -- rather than the &#39;nasty fox&#39; approach.

While English artists dominated the field, many prominent European artists produced a wide range of paintings depicting the dog. Over ninety breeds are depicted in these paintings, from the lap dogs and hunting dogs of the aristocracy to the common shepherd&#39;s dogs who were prized for their keen working abilities. The book concentrates on the types of dogs and dog paintings which were characteristic of the countries of Europe, and the different national attitudes towards dogs and the organisation of canine societies. It also focuses on the many different European breeds. Over ninety are discussed in detail under five headings: Working and Herding; Hounds; Toys and Non-Sporting; Terriers; and Sporting Dogs. Dog Painting - The European Breeds also looks at the art worlds of the different European countries and the numerous artists who portray</p><p>William Secord is President of the William Secord Gallery in New York.

Focusing on the 19th century, Secord first delves into the "dog world" of the different European countriesAhounds on the hunt in France were more likely to be in front of a cart in BelgiumAshowing how their milieus affected the paintings that resulted. Next, he turns to the paintings themselves, and lingers. Many of the 580 illustrations are published here for the first time, with Secord's lively commentary and captions identifying artist, title and provenance of each painting. An appendix of biographies of dog artists will help hardcore buffs keep track, while The Dog Address Book, also available from ACC, lifts many of the best illustrations. This coffee-table book is produced with the kind of care that makes much of the dog-centered stuff out there look crass.

They have nothing in common. Just one amazing, passionate weekend in Chicago and a desire to meet again.</p><p>Chester Himes aficionados who've followed detectives Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones from one grisly Harlem crime scene to the next will find a meaner, harsher reality in <b>The End of a Primitive</b>. In this early work, Himes paints an angry, doomed sexual relationship between a tough-guy black writer down on his luck and a wayward white party girl on a slippery slide toward addiction and abuse. Tough stuff, especially for 1955, when the novel first appeared in a bowdlerized version, and it still carries a tragic punch today, down to its classic pulp diction. Himes, a black writer who did crimes and hard time in his youth, and whose personal quest for a measure of peace finally led him to leave the United States altogether, gives the sure sense of knowing the rough turf and hopeless lives he describes.Shortly before his death, Chester Himes gave an interviewer this remarkable plot summary of The End of a Primitive. &#34;I put a sexually frustrated American woman and a racially frustrated black American male together for a weekend in a New York apartment, and allowed them to soak in American bourbon. I got the result I was looking for: a nightmare of drunkenness, unbridled sexuality, and in the end, tragedy&#34;. This new edition of Himes&#39;s most searing and controversial novel restores the cuts he was forced to make in 1955 in order to get the novel published and includes a never-before-printed foreword by Himes himself.</p><h2>The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad: Rebel of the Rockies (Regents Restoration Drama Series)</h2><p><p>Nowhere better than in the history of its railroads is the growth of the Old West revealed, and for Colorado the development of the Denver and Rio Grande Western epitomizes the changes that took place between 1870 and the present. Robert G. Athearn's intimate knowledge of the West has enabled him to write a gripping account of the famous narrow-gauge Denver and Rio Grande as it inched its way south, then turned west into the Rockies. By f1883 it had joined with the Rio Grande Western to become Colorado's only line across the mountains. The Dotsero Cutoff and the six-mile Moffat Tunnel put Denver on a transcontinental line for the first time. Twelve maps and fifty-five illustrations help tell the story.</p></p><p><p>Robert G.

Is it ever okay to take a life in hopes of saving others?" Prince Damian took a step closer to me, so that I had to tip my head back farther to keep looking up into his eyes. I'd never felt so aware of just how tall he was before. <br> "I think so." I didn't know what to do with him standing so close -- close enough that I could feel the heat from his body. My heart beat erratically and my fingers tingled for some reason. I forced my face to remain impassive. I drew on all of my training, all of the practice I'd had over the years pretending to be a boy, to maintain my composure. With a much steadier, lower voice, I said, "Who's life are you thinking of taking?"<br> "Don't do that with me," he replied, staring down at me with a look of almost hunger on his face. "We're too much alike to pretend with each other. At least when we're alone, let's be who we truly are." The intensity of his gaze nearly made me tremble. <br> No one knew me as I truly was, except for Marcel, and he was gone. <br> But here was Damian, the strikingly handsome, sometimes capricious, sometimes gentle Prince of Antion, asking me to allow him past the guise I'd been holding up to the world since my parents died. How could I do that when all I had done for so long was train to guard him -- and make sure he never realized that deep down inside, buried where no one could see, his best fighter was actually just a frightened girl?</p><h2>A Light in the Castle (The Young Underground #6)</h2><p>In 1945, while taking a train to Copenhagen to meet the King, Peter and Elise meet a man with a strange clocklike device and later have other strange adventures and encounters</p><p><b>Robert Elmer</b> is a graduate of St. Mary's College and Simpson College in San Francisco.

It&#39;s Me, Margaret.</h2><p>A twelve-year-old talks to God about her ardent desire to be grown up.</p><p>If anyone tried to determine the most common rite of passage for preteen girls in North America, a girl's first reading of <i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</i> would rank near the top of the list. Judy Blume and her character Margaret Simon were the first to say out loud (and in a book even) that it is normal for girls to wonder when they are <i>ever</i> going to fill out their training bras. Puberty is a curious and annoying time. Girls' bodies begin to do freakish things--or, as in Margaret's case, they don't do freakish things nearly as fast as girls wish they would. Adolescents are often so relieved to discover that someone understands their body-angst that they miss one of the book's deeper explorations: a young person's relationship with God. Margaret has a very private relationship with God, and it's only after she moves to New Jersey and hangs out with a new friend that she discovers that it might be weird to talk to God without a priest or a rabbi to mediate. Margaret just wants to fit in! Who is God, and where is He when she needs Him? She begins to look into the cups of her training bra for answers ...For Margaret, everything is different this year. She&#39;s just moved from New York City to the suburbs and is anxious to fit in with her new friends--Nancy, Gretchen, and Janie. When they form a secret club to talk about private subjects like boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret is happy to belong. But in Farbrook, everybody joins the Y or the Jewish Community Center. Margaret doesn&#39;t have a religion, so what&#39;s she supposed to do? Suddenly life is very confusing. Maybe it&#39;s all part of growing up, but Margaret could really use some answers.</p><h2>The Burning Edge (A Jack Gannon Novel, 4)</h2><p><br><br>Lisa Palmer has barely recovered from the sudden death of her husband when she is drawn into a new nightmare.

She was trying to get a grip on her life, trying to regain control, but it was hard, so hard. It had been nearly two years since her husband, Bobby, had died, but now, for the first time, Lisa believed that she and her kids would endure.<br><br>They had to.<br><br>They needed to move on with their lives. Selling the cabin in the Adirondacks was the first big step Lisa had taken.<br><br><em>But was it the right thing to do?</em><br><br>She glanced at the passenger seat and the slim briefcase holding all the paperwork. A few hours ago she'd closed the sale at the Realtor's office. The new owners, a retired chef and his wife, a florist, from Newark, would take possession in thirty days.<br><br>The cabin was still Lisa's until then.<br><br>She had promised Ethan and Taylor one last visit to the lake. It was important for all of them to say goodbye to this part of their lives. They'd go up to the cabin together in a few weeks. Lisa brushed a tear from her eye. God, the kids loved it there. She did, too. It was on Lake George and so pretty. It had been in Bobby's family since his greatgrandfather bought it in 1957.<br><br>Bobby had treasured the place. Lisa's hand shook when she'd signed the papers and all the way down I-87 she'd begged Bobby to forgive her.<br><br><em>I had to do it. The insurance is still a mess. The bills keep coming. I can't make ends meet anymore, not on my pay. The cabin was our only asset. I'm so sorry. I have to think of the future; of going on without you.</em><br><br>She would always love Bobby. But while her aching for him would never stop, she found hope in the thick forests that swept down the hills and rock cuts of the region.<br><br>Suddenly, she felt he was near.<br><br>He was a mechanic who'd quit school to work in a garage in Corona. A kind, good-looking guy who was good with cars. He loved history, always had his nose in a book. It was at this point of the cabin drive that he would say that the lumber and iron from these hills helped build New York City. Then he would tell her how George Washington had climbed one of the rocks out there and watched for British ships down by Sandy Hook.<br><br>Lisa smiled at the memory as her Ford Focus glided down the New York Thruway. After drinking the last of her bottled water, she decided she'd take a break at the new truck stop coming up at the exit for Ramapo, which would put her about an hour or so from home.<br><br>This trip to sell the cabin had overwhelmed her. Along the drive, she thought of her best friend from the old neighborhood, Sophia Gretto. They'd grown up together and were like sisters. Even after Sophia had left Queens for college in California they'd kept in touch. Now Sophia was an executive with a public relations firm. Her husband, Ted, was an entertainment lawyer. No children, two Mercedes and a house on Mulholland Drive. Lisa was a supermarket cashier in Queens who never made it to college.<br><br>When Bobby died, Sophia and Ted flew to New York to be with Lisa and the kids. Ted had been a saint. They'd both been so good to her.<br><br>In the months after Bobby's death, Sophia had visited a few times and called almost every day.<br><br>"Why don't you think about moving to Los Angeles," Sophia suggested a few months ago, during one of their calls.<br><br>"I couldn't."<br><br>"Ted and I could get you a job in one of our offices. You could take courses and get your real estate license like we talked about. We could help you, Ethan and Taylor. Think it over."<br><br>"I don't know, Sophia. It could be too much change for the kids."<br><br>"Promise me you'll just think about it, honey, okay?" Lisa did.<br><br>In fact, it was all she could think about.<br><br>Being a cashier was a good job, but it was not what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. Before she'd met Bobby and got pregnant, Lisa had dreamed of going to college to study interior decorating and start her own business. It didn't happen. After high school she had to work to help take care of her mother. Lisa loved Bobby and her life with the kids, but in a far corner of her heart her dream still flickered.<br><br><em>Should she go after it?</em><br><br><em>Could she leave everything here and move to Los Angeles?</em><br><br>"It would be like walking away from him, from the life we had here," Lisa had told Sophia.<br><br>"Lisa, before all this, you were the fiercest, toughest person I've ever known. You could handle anything without anyone's help. So whatever you decide to do, you'll make it work. You just need to get your strength back." Then Sophia said, "You did not die with him."<br><br>"Part of me did."<br><br>"Not all of you. You have a life to live. You have to go on."<br><br>Everything Sophia had said made sense.<br><br>Lisa was about to arrive at a decision as she left the thruway and wheeled into the big, new Freedom Freeway Service Center at Ramapo. She parked some distance from the rigs easing in and out of the lot. Diesel engines growled, air brakes hissed. She was enveloped by humid air as she walked across the hot pavement.<br><br>After driving nearly two hundred miles, stretching her legs was a luxury.<br><br>The interstate traffic droned.<br><br>The building was landscaped with clipped shrubs. Its neo-deco facade had huge windows. New York State flags and the Stars and Stripes flapped on gold-tipped poles above the mammoth entrance.<br><br>Inside, the air-conditioning was soothing. After using the restroom, Lisa went to the snack shop for bottled water, a candy bar, a comic for Ethan and a magazine for Taylor. She knew she shouldn't be spending the money, but she missed her kids and wanted to give them something.<br><br>A few people stood ahead of her to pay.<br><br>As the line advanced, all the lights went off. The ventilation fans stopped and the building lost power. People glanced at each other for an answer. A moment later, the lights came back on and the fans restarted.<br><br>Keys jingled and a man in a business jacket loosened his tie, hurried from a rear office toward the restaurant, grumbling to the woman accompanying him. "Call them and tell them it's another false alarm."<br><br>Lisa saw the man go to a control panel at the far end of the restaurant. The panel's lights stopped flashing after he inserted a key and turned it.<br><br><em>Must be this hot weather straining the air-conditioning.</em><br><br><em>Come on, please.</em><br><br>This was taking longer than she'd expected and she still faced New York traffic. She wanted to get back on the road.<br><br>Lisa looked outside as an American Centurion armored truck stopped in front of the lobby, which had three ATMs. One guard started loading a cart while another stood by, scanning the lot and the building.<br><br>The guards started for the entrance as Lisa stepped to the counter. After paying, she slid her items and wallet into her shoulder bag. Then she made a quick search in her bag for her supermarket ID, not certain if she'd left it at home, or if she'd thrust it in her bag after finishing her shift before driving upstate.<br><br>She barely noticed the rumble of the four motorcycles that had pulled up alongside the armored truck. Adjusting her bag, she saw several people standing near the ATMs; some were studying the large map of Greater New York City above the machines.<br><br>As the armored truck guards entered, Lisa froze.<br><br>Two of the motorcycle riders, their faces hidden by their helmets and dark shields, were dressed in full-body riding suits that were bulky around their abdomens. They were wearing gloves and gripping handguns as they came up behind the guards.<br><br><em>Pop!</em><br><br>The first rider shot the first guard. A gout of blood and fragments of his skull blasted across the floor to a vending machine.<br><br>At the same time, the second rider came up on the guard wheeling the money cart and fired into the back of his neck. <em>Crack!</em> The impact forced the top of the guard's head to flap open, cranial matter springing out. The money cart clanged to the floor between the dead men, their blood blossoming into widening pools.<br><br>Lisa caught her breath.<br><br>"Everyone down!" the first shooter yelled, seizing the guards' guns. "Nobody fucking move! Put your phones on the floor beside you now! Put your hands behind your head! Look at the floor! Don't look at us!"<br><br>Lisa slid to the floor. Her magazines, water and other items tumbled from her bag around her.<br><br>The second rider produced a sack and moved swiftly, collecting cell phones from staff and customers throughout the center.<br><br>Outside, the two other riders had sprayed something into the truck's air intake, forcing the driver to exit, double over and vomit.

The other gunman produced folded nylon bags and commanded the nearest person, a sobbing teenage girl, to help him fill them. The plastic wrapped around some of the cash had torn. Bundles had rolled over the center's floor lobby near Lisa.<br><br>The gunman collecting the cash grunted as he snatched the packs that had fallen around her, whizzing them into the nylon bags. His partner eyed the people on the floor for movement.<br><br><em>Please, God, let someone call the police,</em> Lisa thought.<br><br>The man on the floor next to Lisa turned his face to her. He looked about thirty, was clean shaven with quick intelligent eyes. He was wearing jeans, a jacket and T-shirt.<br><br>"I'm a cop," he whispered, keeping his hands outstretched over his head. "My gun's on my right hip under my shirt."<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>"You slide closer, lift it out," he said. "Tuck it under me. They're wearing vests, but I can get off head shots." Lisa could not breathe.<br><br>She was motionless until the man's urgent gaze compelled her to move. She worked her way closer to him, carefully extending her left hand, pulling away his jacket, feeling the hardness of his gun. Lisa got it loose. Her sweating face was two feet from his.<br><br>He nodded encouragement.<br><br>As Lisa pulled, the weapon slipped from her fingers and rattled on the floor. A gunman flew to them, grabbing the gun before the cop could. He patted the man, taking his second gun from his ankle holster.

The agent blinked and said, "Jennifer, I love you," before his skull exploded, propelling brain matter onto Lisa's face.<br><br>The killer moved and pressed his gun to her head.<br><br></p><h2>The Discovery of Noah&#39;s Ark</h2><p>The discovery of Noah&#39;s Ark is one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century, solving a mystery that has puzzled scientists for many centuries. The story of the clues which led to its detection - not on Mount Ararat, as had been thought, but on Mount Mahser Dagi (the Doomsday Mountain) some 17 miles to the south - is astonishing, and the material uncovered reveals much about life in the Middle East thousands of years BC. David Fasold headed one of the last teams to be allowed excavation rights in Turkey, and he dedicated years of his life and considerable sums of his own money to searching for the Ark. This book recounts the story of his quest and the eventual realization that he had succeeded when the dimensions of his find matched up exactly to those given in the Book of Genesis. Drilling samples subsequently revealed that the boat had not been made of wood, as was commonly supposed, but of reed and a kind of cement. Fasold&#39;s site has now been sealed off and officially declared the landing place of Noah&#39;s Ark by the Turkish Government.</p><p></p><h2>Homeland and Other Stories</h2><p>Presents a selection of stories featuring characters bound by a strong sense of place and the ties of love and family history, in such tales as &#34;Blueprints,&#34; &#34;Why I Am a Danger to the Public,&#34; and &#34;Homeland&#34;</p><p><p>With the same wit and sensitivity that have come to characterize her highly praised and beloved novels <em>Animal Dreams</em> and <em>The Bean Trees,</em> Barbara Kingsolver gives us a rich and emotionally resonant collection of twelve stories. Spreading her memorable characters over landscapes ranging from northern-California to the hills of eastern Kentucky and the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, Kingsolver tells stories of hope, momentary joy, and powerful endurance. In every setting, Kingsolver's distinctive voice -- at times comic, but often heartrending -- rings true as she explores the twin themes of family ties and the life choices one must ultimately make alone. <em>Homeland and Other Stories</em> creates a world of love and possibility that readers will want to take as their own.</p><p>Barbara Kingsolver's work has been translated into more than twenty languages and has earned a devoted readership at home and abroad. She was awarded the National Humanities Medal, our country's highest honor for service through the arts. She received the 2011 Dayton Literary Peace Prize for the body of her work, and in 2010 won Britain's Orange Prize for <em>The Lacuna</em>. Before she made her living as a writer, Kingsolver earned degrees in biology and worked as a scientist.

When the Allies invaded Normandy on June 6, 1944, one hundred orphaned girls were forced to flee their orphanage in Caen, France, the only home many of them had ever known. They began a trek on foot to a safer location, to Beaufort-en-Vall�e, a town one hundred and fifty miles away. As the war raged on all sides of them, the girls, led by their teachers, bravely marched south, keeping one step ahead of the fighting and waving little white flags for protection. Told through their own drawings and words, this moving and timely book details their experiences on their journey to safety.</p><p><b>Nancy Amis</b> biked from Caen to Beaufort-en-Vall�e in the spring of 2000, following the route of the one hundred orphans. Using their hand-drawn map as a guide, she uncovered many of the questions she had about the story of the journey that she has known since childhood. Nancy has two sons and is an artist who lives in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. This is her first book.Grade 3-6-When Allied forces invaded Normandy in the summer of 1944, 100 girls were forced to leave the orphanage that they called home on the bank of the Orne. For 38 days they lived in a mine, then walked 150 miles before they reached their destination of Beaufort-en-Vallee. This book reproduces pages from the girls' illustrated account of that time and journey. Each right-hand page offers an image from their journal. The colored pencil on newsprint pictures include the artist's name and age and are accompanied by a few lines of handwritten text in French. An English translation appears on the left in a typeface resembling handwriting of the journal. The pleasing design will invite readers to examine the detailed drawings. An introduction and afterword explain how the author's aunt received the girls' journal, a map of their journey, and the appended black-and-white photos.

From the deck of a commercial fishing boat in Alaska to the fish farms in Scotland, she has traveled the world on a quest to find out everything there is to know about the world's favorite fresh fish. Learn the difference between wild and farmed salmon, discern among the varieties of species, whether Atlantic, Chinook, Coho, or Sockeye, and discover the heart-healthy benefits of including salmon in the diet. The real catch are the recipes. Salmon Hash, Thai Coconut Soup, Salmon Tacos, and a dramatic yet simple whole roasted version show the incredible versatility of salmon it's perfect morning, noon, and night. It pairs well with an international array of flavors and can be poached, smoked, baked, or grilled. With tips for storing, preparing, filleting, cutting steaks, taking out pin bones, plus gorgeous scenic photographs of famed fishing areas, <i>Salmon</i> is sure to make a big splash in the kitchen.</p><p>Diane Morgan is an experienced cooking teacher and the author of many cookbooks, including Delicious Dips (0-8118-4220-7), Dressed to Grill (0-8118-3139-6), and The Thanksgiving Table (0-8118-2991-X).

She lives in Seattle, Washington.<br><br>John Ash is a notable chef and food writer. He is the author of the IACP-winning From the Earth to the Table .A beautiful cookbook with impressive photographs, Morgan&#39;s volume contains many tasty recipes, but it&#39;s not really a complete introduction to salmon. A number of her dishes are influenced by Mediterranean and Asian cuisine; others, like Pan-Roasted Salmon with a Pomegranate and Fennel Salsa, use the sparkle of trendy ingredients to enhance the fish&#39;s robust flavor. The prolific author (Dressed to Grill, Delicious Dips, etc.) introduces several unusual cooking techniques, urging readers to marinate, cure, preserve, deep-fry, poach, blacken, wok smoke, crust, slow roast, pan roast and grill their fillets, steaks and whole salmon. The recipes themselves, however, can sometimes be confusing, since they often combine the instructions for several parts of the dish into one paragraph, which can also make improvisation difficult. Nonetheless, Morgan offers variety that any fish-lover will appreciate. From Grilled Salmon Tacos with Chipotle Sauce to Risotto with Salmon, Parsley and Green Onions, to Asian Noodle Salad with Sesame-Crusted Salmon, her book has a dish for every occasion. An enthusiastic introduction covers such topics as cleaning and storing the fish, but readers already familiar with the salmon industry may find her handling of some of these opening topics a bit superficial. Clearly, Morgan is a cook, not a salmon specialist. Her discussion of the different species of Pacific Salmon, for example, does not explain flavor variations and seasonal changes (and what these shifts mean to the consumer) and, though she extols the virtues of the Copper River Salmon, she neglects to mention the fresher, larger and more frequently available salmon varieties from Southeast Alaska. Her book is a great resource for casual cooks, but those seeking a more authoritative compendium may want to look elsewhere.</p><h2>One Christmas in Washington</h2><p>This volume offers a fascinating look at the weeks between December 1941 and January 1942, when Churchill and Roosevelt met at the White House, forging what turned out to be the Grand Alliance--while in the background, a confused America celebrated Christmas.</p><p>How ten days in Washington, over Christmas 1941, changed the fate of the world as Roosevelt and Churchill secretly forged the Grand Alliance.David J.

Nicknamed "Zippy" for the way she would bolt around the house, this small girl was possessed of big eyes and even bigger ears. In this witty and lovingly told memoir, Kimmel takes readers back to a time when small-town America was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar period--people helped their neighbors, went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards.<br><br>To three-year-old Zippy, it made perfect sense to strike a bargain with her father to keep her baby bottle--never mind that when she did, it was the first time she'd ever spoken. In her nonplussed family, Zippy has the perfect supporting cast: her beautiful yet dour brother, Danny, a seeker of the true faith; her sweetly sensible sister, Lindy, who wins the local beauty pageant; her mother, Delonda, who dispenses wisdom from the corner of the couch; and her father, Bob Jarvis, who never met a bet he didn't like. <br><br>Whether describing a serious case of chicken love, another episode with the evil Edythe across the street, or the night Zippy's dad borrowed thirty-six coon dogs and a raccoon to prove to the complaining neighbors just how quiet his two dogs were, Kimmel treats readers to a heroine who is wonderfully sweet and shy as she navigates the quirky adult world surrounding Zippy.<br></p><p><b>From Publishers Weekly</b> <p> It's a cliche to say that a good memoir reads like a well-crafted work of fiction, but Kimmel's smooth, impeccably humorous prose evokes her childhood as vividly as any novel. Born in 1965, she grew up in Mooreland, Ind., a place that by some "mysterious and powerful mathematical principle" perpetually retains a population of 300, a place where there's no point learning the street names because it's just as easy to say, "We live at the four-way stop sign." Hers is less a formal autobiography than a collection of vignettes comprising the things a small child would remember: sick birds, a new bike, reading comics at the drugstore, the mean old lady down the street. The truths of childhood are rendered in lush yet simple prose; here's Zippy describing a friend who hates wearing girls' clothes: "Julie in a dress was like the rest of us in quicksand." Over and over, we encounter pearls of third-grade wisdom revealed in a child's assured voice: "There are a finite number of times one can safely climb the same tree in a single day"; or, regarding Jesus, "Everyone around me was flat-out in love with him, and who wouldn't be? He was good with animals, he loved his mother, and he wasn't afraid of blind people." (Mar.)Forecast: Dreamy and comforting, spiced with flashes of wit, this book seems a natural for readers of the Oprah school of women's fiction (e.g., Elizabeth Berg, Janet Fitch). The startling baby photograph on the cover should catch browsers' eyes. </p><p> <i>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</i> </p><p> <b>From Booklist</b> </p><p> The title is awful, but Kimmel's childhood memoir rings true. Mooreland had a population of about 300, small enough for a grade-school girl to explore every corner and have strong opinions about the town's adults. More important, however, than the mean old lady across the street and the loud old man at the drugstore were Kimmel's family (parents, older brother and sister, and various pets) and the "best friends" with whom she experienced her small world. Kimmel remembers vividly what it felt like to be a kid: the pleasure of being outdoors; the unquestioned bonds of a "best" friendship; and the oddness of many of the things adults (and teenagers) do. Even in the 1960s and 1970s (Kimmel was born in 1965), Mooreland escaped the larger society's disruptions. An empty store was a Ku Klux Klan headquarters in the 1920s, but there were no African Americans around town; a pair of hippies moved in and offered Zippy a chance to give her dad a valued present. </p><p> <i>Mary Carroll Copyright American Library Association. All rights reserved </i> </p><p> <b>From Library Journal</b></p><p> In this first book, Kimmel has written a love letter to her hometown of Mooreland, IN, a town with an unchanging population of 300 in America's heartland. Nicknamed "Zippy" for her energetic interpretation of a circus monkey, she could not be bothered to speak until she was three years old, and her first words involved bargaining with her father about whether or not a baby bottle was still appropriate. Born in 1965, Zippy lived in a world filled with a loving family, peculiar neighbors, and multitudes of animals, including a chicken she loved and treated like a baby. Her story is filled with good humor, fine storytelling, and acute observations of small town life.

Peter Schweizer delves into the origins of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s vision of America, and documents his consistent, aggressive belief in confronting the Soviet Union diplomatically, economically, and militarily.<br><b><br></b>Ronald Reagan is often dismissed as an &#x201c;amiable dunce,&#x201d; a genial actor who simply mouthed whatever slogans his right-wing puppet masters put in front of him. Reagan&#x2019;s War brilliantly overturns this myth. Drawing on private diaries dating from Reagan&#x2019;s days as an actor and extending through his presidency, Peter Schweizer, a well-known historian of the Cold War, shows that Reagan&#x2019;s fervent anticommunism marked every era of his life and was the driving force behind his policies as president.<br><br>Schweizer explores Reagan&#x2019;s involvement with anticommunist liberals in Hollywood and his role as a secret informer for the FBI. Reagan&#x2019;s outspoken criticism of d?tente in the late 1960s and his forceful advocacy for the overthrow of the USSR drew the attention of Soviet officials, who began a KGB file on him when he was still governor of California. By the time he was elected president, they viewed him as a serious threat to their interests. Reagan&#x2019;s War shows just how right they were, presenting compelling evidence that Reagan personally mapped out and directed a campaign to bankrupt the Soviet Union and wage an economic and political war against Moscow.<br><br>In telling the story of Reagan&#x2019;s ultimate triumph, Schweizer also brings to light dozens of previously unknown facts about the Cold War, based on secret documents obtained from archives in Russia, Germany, Poland, Hungary, and the United States. Among his many startling revelations are Kissinger&#x2019;s private deals with Soviet leaders that protected his own political viability while allowing the Soviets to pursue their goals within their own sphere; a North Korean and East German plot to assassinate Reagan in 1983; Reagan&#x2019;s secret funding of Solidarity in Poland; and the behind-the-scenes support Soviets and East Germans provided for European and American peace movements, as well as their clandestine contacts with U.S. government officials.<br><br>A fresh, often startling look at Ronald Reagan and his central role in winning the war for global dominance in the 1980s, <i>Reagan&#x2019;s Wa</i>r is a major work of twentieth-century history.</p><p>"Peter Schweizer has written a profound and important book which is also compulsive reading. The Ronald Reagan he depicts is a man utterly consistent in his beliefs and analysis from his earliest forays into politics. While others were distracted by short-term considerations, President Reagan single-mindedly pursued his vast strategic goals--and he succeeded. Was there ever a better example of statesmanship in action?"<br>--<i>Lady Margaret Thatcher</i><br>"Ronald Reagan played an invaluable role in bringing about the fall of communism and ending the Cold War without resorting to military solutions. Without his great political sense and prudence, instead of the popping of champagne corks, the world would have heard real artillery shots. We [in the Solidarity movement] sensed President Reagan's support and understanding and never had to ask for or demand it. This is not something easily found in the world of politics."<br>--<i>Lech Walesa, former president of Poland<br></i>"In <i>Reagan's War</i>, Peter Schweizer has given us a timely and skilled history of Ronald Reagan's 40-year struggle against Communism that brings home the twin beacons he followed: we must be guided not by fear but by courage and moral clarity. This is a superb history that demonstrates why Reagan won the Cold War, and why it never would have been won without him."<br>--<i>Caspar W. Weinberger, Chairman, Forbes, Inc.<br></i>"A masterstroke. Schweizer uses the secret archives of the Soviet Union and its satellites to outline with amazing detail the seriousness of the Soviet threat, the failures of the American establishment, and the brilliance of Reagan's strategy for victory.

His provocative vision of the future will change the way we think about viruses, and perhaps remove a potential threat to humanity's survival. </p></p><p><p>Nathan Wolfe is the Lorry I.

Located in the west of the country near the border of Burma, Pang Thruk is home to about three thousand people whose livelihoods depend on the sugar and rice they grow. In December 2003, it was also home to Kaptan Boonmanuch, a six-year-old boy who would be among the first people to die of a brand-new human virus.</p><p>Kaptan loved riding his bicycle, climbing trees, and playing with his plastic toy Dalmatian that pulled three puppies in tiny brown wagons as it barked mechanically. Kaptan also enjoyed helping his family on the farm.</p><p>Nearly every family in Pang Thruk kept egg-laying chickens; some also kept roosters for cock fighting. Kaptan's aunt and uncle lived just down the road on their open-air farm of around three hundred chickens. Each winter in the village a few chickens would die from suspected infections or colds, but in December 2003 chicken deaths increased dramatically. That winter, as on many farms in this region, the chickens in Kaptan's uncle's farm suffered from severe diarrhea, strange behavior, and weakness. All of them either died naturally or were culled as a result of their illness&#x2014;and Kaptan helped with the dead. A day or two before the New Year, according to reports, the boy carried one of the sick squawking chickens home. That walk home would have lasted no more than a few minutes.</p><p>A few days later Kaptan grew feverish. A clinic in the village diagnosed him with a cold, but after three days without improvement, his father, Chamnan, a rice farmer who worked part time as a driver, took him to a public hospital. X-rays revealed that the six-year-old had pneumonia, and he was kept in the hospital for observation. A few days more and Kaptan's fever spiked to a dangerous 105 degrees. His father paid the equivalent of thirty-six dollars for an ambulance to speed him to better care at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, more than an hour's drive away.</p><p>Upon arrival, Kaptan presented with shortness of breath and fever. Tests revealed that both lungs were affected with severe pneumonia, and the boy was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit and put on a ventilator. A series of bacterial cultures tested negative, showing that the infection was likely caused by a virus. More detailed testing using a molecular technique called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, revealed that Kaptan was likely infected with an atypical type of influenza&#x2014;perhaps one not yet seen (or seen widely) in humans.</p><p>After eleven days of illness, the boy's fever finally began to cool off. However, despite intensive care, his respiratory distress worsened. Just before midnight on January 25, physicians took Kaptan off the respirator. His lungs drowning in fluids, he became Thailand's first known death from H5N1, which would soon become known around the world as "bird flu."</p><p>As sad as Kaptan's death was&#x2014;and the reports go on to describe the boy's funeral and the family's mourning in tragic detail&#x2014;the reality is that children in the developing world die from diseases like this all the time. And infectious diseases, which scientists in the 1960s predicted would be eliminated in short order, remain some of the most important killers today. But when it comes to global risk, all deaths are not equal. Most deaths from infectious diseases are localized events that, while dire for the victims and their families, present limited risk to the planet as a whole. But some, like Kaptan's, signal a potentially world-altering event: the first human infection by an animal virus that may wipe out millions, or hundreds of millions, of people throughout the planet&#x2014;permanently changing the face of humanity.</p><p>The main objective of my work is to hunt down these events&#x2014;the first moments at the birth of a new pandemic&#x2014;and then work to understand and stop them before they reach a global stage. Because pandemics almost always begin with the transmission of an animal microbe to a human, it's work that takes me all around the globe&#x2014;from rain forest hunting camps of central Africa to wild animal markets of east Asia. But it also takes me to cutting-edge laboratories at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and disease outbreak control centers at the World Health Organization (WHO). Tracking down these potentially devastating bugs has led me to study how, where, and why pandemics are born. I work to create systems that can accurately detect pandemics early, determine their likely importance, and, with any luck, crush those that have the potential to devastate us.</p><p>As I've lectured on this work around the world and taught undergraduates in my virology seminar at Stanford University, it's hard to ignore a growing general interest in these topics. Everyone recognizes the raw power that pandemics have to sweep through human populations and seemingly kill indiscriminately. Yet, given the importance of these events, large questions remain remarkably opaque:</p><p>How do pandemics start?</p><p>Why are we now plagued with so many pandemics?</p><p>What can we do to prevent pandemics in the future?</p><p>This book is my attempt to answer these questions&#x2014;an effort to assemble the pieces of the pandemic puzzle.</p><p>Part I, "Gathering Clouds," introduces our main character, the microbe, [1] and delves into the history of our relationships with these organisms. It explores the vast world of microbes, putting those that threaten us in their proper perspective. It details some of the most significant events in the evolution of humans and our ancestors and works to develop the often-spotty historical data into a set of hypotheses on how the events influenced our interactions with microbes.</p><p>Part II, "The Tempest," examines how contemporary human populations have grown so exquisitely susceptible to pandemics and what the future years will hold for pandemic diseases. Part III, "The Forecast," describes the fascinating new world of <i>pandemic prevention</i> and introduces a new crop of scientists eager to help create a virtual global immune system that will stop pandemics before they become planetary nightmares. Along the way, we will journey to remote hunting villages in central Africa, investigate malaria in wild orangutans in Borneo, learn how cutting-edge genetic sequencing tools will change the way that we discover completely novel viruses, and see how Silicon Valley companies may forever transform the way that we conduct surveillance aimed at finding the next major outbreak.</p><p>At this point you may be asking yourself how someone ends up devoting his career to the study of plagues. Is it a desire to save the world? Or perhaps it's the scientific thrill of discovering completely unknown, invisible beings with the potential to wipe out large swaths of humanity. Maybe it's the desire to understand in detail one part of humans' intricate ecology. Or it's an urge to explore the exotic locations on Earth where these novel viruses often appear. But while my life is now consumed with trying to understand and stop pandemics, that's not how it's always been. My work with microbes actually started as a minor footnote to a study I wanted to conduct among wild chimpanzees in central Africa.</p><p>As a young child, I acquired what would become a lifelong interest in apes when I watched a <i>National Geographic</i> documentary explaining how humans are more closely related to apes than we are to monkeys. A family tree with humans and apes as siblings (and monkeys as distant cousins) was entirely inconsistent with my memories of seeing these creatures locked up together in the "monkey house" at the Detroit Zoo. We humans were outside the cages, and the rest of <i>them</i> were inside. The idea that apes and humans were closely related certainly struck a chord with me. According to my father, I spent some days after the documentary playing the part: walking around the house on all fours, trying to communicate without language, and otherwise working to bring out my inner ape.</p><p>My fascination with apes evolved from a childish curiosity to an intellectual interest in what our closest relatives had to tell us about ourselves. What began as a broad interest in apes as animals became a more specific interest in chimpanzees and their less acknowledged brethren, the bonobos&#x2014;the two ape species that share our own particular branch of the tree of life. How did the years of separation since our last common ancestor with these two kindred ape species shape our minds, our bodies, and our worlds? What features remained the same in all of us?</p><p>Along with the intellectual interest, I had a growing desire to see these apes living in their natural environment. This desire required tracking them down in the rain forests of central Africa to see for myself what they were really like. So when choosing among doctoral programs, I settled on one at Harvard where I&nbsp;would work with Richard Wrangham and Marc Hauser, two prominent primatologists. I would spend many months during my first year of doctoral work arguing why they should let me study the troops of wild chimpanzees that Wrangham had worked with for years in the Kibale Forest in southwest Uganda.</p><p>I proposed a study to document self-medicating behavior of the Kibale chimpanzees. The idea that these animals consumed plants with specific medicinal chemicals as a way of fighting against their own infectious diseases was still just an hypothesis at the time, and an intriguing one. I'd explored this idea the previous year while studying at Oxford and working on an exhibit about animal self-medication at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.</p><p>The Oxford University Museum is a magnificent nineteenth-century building constructed in the architectural style of a Gothic cathedral but with massive iron supports mimicking the skeleton of a mammal, emphasizing that it was a church of natural history rather than religion. It houses unique collections, including some of the beetles collected by Charles Darwin on his celebrated voyage on the <i>Beagle</i>. It had been home to the famous Huxley-Wilberforce debate on natural selection in 1860 seven months after the publication of Darwin's pivotal book <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. It's a perfect location to ponder the place of humans in the natural world. The work I did under the supervision of the eminent evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamillton and his colleague Dale Clayton, an expert in behaviors animals used to rid themselves of parasites, revealed that self-medication was widespread in the animal kingdom. Animals as disparate as wasps and Kodiak bears utilized the chemical defenses of plants to help rid themselves of their natural pests.</p><p>As I began my work in Uganda to study chimpanzees, my professors cautioned me that any convincing proof that chimpanzees were medicating themselves with plants would require an understanding of the infectious diseases they were treating. Unless I could show that the use of the purported medicines decreased the burden of disease, my results would be speculative at best. I needed to understand what infectious diseases plagued the chimpanzees. I knew little about microbes, so I approached Andy Spielman, a professor at Harvard's School of Public Health and one of the few people at the time focused on understanding the ecology of microbes in nature. Despite his lab full of fellows and students and his focus on North America rather than the wilds of Africa or Asia, he kindly took me under his wing. Thus began my research on what was known about the infections of chimpanzees. Once I began thinking about microbes I never looked back. And central to my studies would be the viruses.</p><p>Viruses evolve more rapidly than any organism on the planet, yet we understand less about them than any other form of life. [2] The study of viruses provides a scientist with the opportunity to discover new species and catalog them in a way reminiscent of the world of the nineteenth-century naturalist, which had so fascinated me during my time at Oxford. A scientist can productively spend an entire career looking for new species of primate and never find one, but new viruses are discovered every year. They also have exceedingly short generations, so we can watch them evolve in real time&#x2014;an ideal system for someone interested in understanding the process of evolution. Perhaps best of all from the perspective of a young scientist, there was important and urgent low-hanging fruit in this discipline: some of these viruses kill us. Thus new discoveries need not only lead to an improved understanding of nature, but they can also have important and rapid applications for controlling human disease.</p><p>Controlling the spread of human disease was at the forefront of public health efforts in early 2004 when the news broke of Kaptan's death from H5N1. His death was the first confirmed mortality from this virus, the so-called bird flu, in Thailand. The truth is that while they may jump to us via other animals, <i>all</i> human influenza viruses ultimately originate in birds, so the popular designation of the virus as "bird flu" can irritate scientists. Yet within a month that name would become a mainstay of news shows and a topic of discussion for people throughout the world.</p><p>The scientific name for the virus that killed Kaptan, HPAIA (H5N1), is quite descriptive for virologists. It signifies that the virus is a highly pathogenic avian influenza A-type virus and provides the particular hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) protein variants particular to this virus strain. But its true significance is actually much more straightforward.</p><p>H5N1 is important because it kills remarkably effectively. The virus's case fatality rate, or the percentage of infected individuals that die, is around 60 percent. For a microbe, that's incredibly deadly. As a comparison, we can look back to the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. While estimates for the 1918 pandemic are imperfect, it is thought around fifty million people died. That's the equivalent of 3 percent of the entire human population at that time, an almost unimaginable catastrophe. To put this in context, more people died from the 1918 influenza pandemic than the total number of soldiers thought to have died in battle during all twentieth-century wars <i>combined</i>. More deaths caused by a simple virus, less than one hundred nanometers in diameter and with only a paltry eleven genes, than were caused by all the battles in WWI, WWII, and all of the other wars in our last war-riddled century. Despite the enormity of the 1918 plague, the highest estimates for its case fatality rate are in the range of 20 percent, and it was almost certainly much lower than that; more careful estimates suggest around 2.5 percent. [3] Recall that H5N1 had a 60 percent fatality rate, far greater than that of the influenza virus that caused the 1918 pandemic.</p><p>But while deadliness is an important, dramatic, and ongoing obsession of the media, it is only one piece of the puzzle for microbiologists. In fact, some microbes kill virtually all people they infect: a perfect 100 percent mortality rate. And yet such microbes do not necessarily represent critical threats to humanity. Viruses like rabi...</p></p><h2>Creative Illustration &amp; Beyond: Inspiring tips, techniques, and ideas for transforming doodled designs into whimsical artistic illustrations and mixed-media projects (Creative...and Beyond)</h2><p>You learned the fine art of doodling with Walter Foster&#x2019;s bestselling <i>Creative Doodling &amp; Beyond</i>.

She was recently voted one of the three most popular authors in Israel.<br><br><br>Chapter 1<br><br>It happened, like all horrible things happen, at the most inconvenient time.<br>Abigail Samuels awoke as the sun streamed through the leaded glass of her beautiful French patio doors. Her eyes opened slowly, taking in the delicate lace of her curtains and the polished wood of her antique canopy bed. Her husband&#x2019;s gentle kiss lingered on her lips, a faint, sweet memory. It was Tuesday, her day off, and he had tried not to wake her before leaving for work.<br>I&#x2019;m so lucky, she thought, humming her most recent download from iTunes&#x2014;a catchy paean of love and longing written and performed by a sixteen-year-old. She might be getting old, but her taste in music hadn&#x2019;t changed; she still loved anything that made her want to dance. That, too, made her happy.<br>The water was hot enough to burn you, she thought with pleasure, adjusting the temperature controls on the frighteningly expensive mixer faucet. She remembered their leaner years, the first apartment with the broken-down shower that only gave you lukewarm water until noon, and then only enough for one.<br>She reached for a thick, fluffy bath sheet, catching a glimpse of her nude body in the mirror. Staring at her overlarge breasts, her rounded stomach and thighs, she wondered where her own body had gone. She looked like a Renoir painting, Baigneuse, or Bather Arranging Her Hair, unfashionably heavy, but not unattractive. To her surprise, instead of being depressed, she felt the word &#x201c;sexuality&#x201d; echo in her head. She wondered what that meant at her age, with a husband who had been her boyfriend, and who loved her&#x2014;with this body and the original&#x2014;and whom she had loved back now for forty-odd years?<br>Wrapping the towel around her, she looked into the mirror, combing her wet hair. It had retained its thickness and its sheen, although the days when it flowed down her back like a dark river were long gone, along with her natural mahogany color. It was short and honey brown now, a color that came from bottles and tubes, and was applied with plastic gloves. And while her face had retained its lean shape and had surprisingly few wrinkles&#x2014;testifying to a calm, pampered, and, for the most part, happy life&#x2014;her eyelids had begun to droop and her forehead crease. Only in her eyes&#x2014;large, dark brown ovals that still flashed with amusement and curiosity&#x2014;did she sometimes glimpse the person she remembered as herself.<br>Impulsively, she threw open the patio doors, stepping out onto the veranda. &#x201c;What a lark! What a plunge . . . ! Like the flap of a wave . . . the kiss of a wave,&#x201d; she thought, remembering the words from Mrs. Dalloway she had just taught her eleventh-graders. The pungent scent of damp fall leaves rose up to meet her, the crisp Boston air like chilled cider, intoxicating.<br>She loved the fall, all the sun-faded colors of summer repainted by vivid reds and golds still clinging fragilely to branches that would soon be covered with snow.<br>What a wonder! My lovely home. My marvelous garden as big as a park, tended by meticulous gardeners. My daughter&#x2019;s engagement. Planning her party. The blue Boston sky. She pirouetted around the room. It would not rain today, no matter what the weather report predicted. Today would be perfect, she thought, slipping on clothes that were unseasonably light.<br>Walking down the hallway, she could already hear the buzz of the vacuum cleaner as the household began its day without her. No matter how many years she had employed cleaning help, she still hadn&#x2019;t gotten used to it. Perhaps the housekeepers could feel her discomfort. They never stayed very long.<br>Esmeralda had been with them for six months now. She was in the dining room, working on the carpets. When she saw Abigail, she turned off the machine, her round face, creaseless as a fall apple, looking up warily.<br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t stop! I just wanted to say good morning and to tell you I&#x2019;m going out for a while, to make some arrangements for the party.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The engagement party. For your daughter. Miss Kayla.&#x201d; The woman nodded and smiled politely, pretending to care. Abigail smiled back graciously, pretending to believe she cared.<br>Lovely to be walking down the street in the early part of the day instead of stuck in a classroom! She exulted like Clarissa Dalloway, loving &#x201c;. . . the wing, tramp, and trudge; . . . the bellow and uproar; . . . the motor cars, omnibuses, vans . . . the triumph and jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead;&#x201d; life, Boston, this moment of September.<br>She smiled at her shadow as though it were a companion, delighted at the kindly angle of the sun that had airbrushed all the sordid details of aging. But then she noticed the little tufts of hair that stood up waving in the wind&#x2014;another expensive hairdresser&#x2019;s experiment gone wrong. Ah, well; she smiled to herself, patting them down. What was such a whisper of annoyance next to the ode to joy resonating loudly throughout every fiber of her being?<br>She raised her face to the sky, beaming at God.<br>So perfect!<br>The words had become almost a mantra over the last month, beginning the moment Kayla&#x2014;her hand clasped tightly in Seth&#x2019;s&#x2014;announced: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re engaged!&#x201d;<br>She closed her eyes for a moment, savoring the memory: her youngest child&#x2019;s shining face, her big, hazel eyes full of glint and sparkle, like well-cut jewels, revealing their many facets. She recalled clearly the pride and triumph, but somehow the happiness and love were more elusive, like water in sand, absorbed and swallowed. But those things were a given, were they not?<br>For what was there not to be happy about? Even Kayla, used to golden fleeces falling into her lap without any long quests, must appreciate the answer to every Jewish mother&#x2019;s prayer who would soon, God willing, be her husband. Congratulating them was like making the blessing over a perfect fruit that you hadn&#x2019;t tasted for a long time, Abigail thought: two Harvard Law School students, both Jewish, both from well-to-do families, members of the same synagogue in an exclusive Boston suburb.<br>But even as she exhaled gratitude like a prayer, she acknowledged it wasn&#x2019;t all luck. I had something to do with it, she told herself, almost giddy with triumph. What hadn&#x2019;t she done to nurture Kayla? The bedtime stories, the elaborate birthday parties, the shopping trips, the decorator bedroom, the private tutors, the long talks, the faithful attendance at every class assembly, play, and athletic event . . . And Kayla had repaid her beyond her wildest dreams. Straight A&#x2019;s, valedictorian, youth ambassador to Norway . . . And now, soon to be a Harvard Law School graduate.<br>Like an athlete standing on a podium about to hear the national anthem played before the world because they had jumped the highest, run the fastest, thrown the farthest, Abigail exulted in her motherly triumph. Her nerves rock steady, her hands and feet swift and unswerving, she had run all the hurdles of modern motherhood with this child, if not with her older brother and sister, perfecting her mothering skills. Too bad they didn&#x2019;t give out medals. With Kayla, she had certainly earned the gold.<br>She heard a car honking and turned around. It was Judith, the rabbi&#x2019;s wife. She had a huge smile on her face as she mouthed the words Mazal tov! behind her windshield.<br>There had been no official announcement yet. Still, everyone had heard through the grapevine.<br>Thank you! Abigail mouthed back. At just that moment, she saw Mrs. Schwartz walking across the street in the opposite direction.<br>&#x201c;Abigail! Just heard about Kayla! How wonderful!&#x201d; She cupped her mouth, shouting.<br>Abigail waved, delighted. &#x201c;Thank you! Thank you!&#x201d; She shouted back. &#x201c;Are you coming to the party?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t miss it!&#x201d;<br>She felt almost like a celebrity, as if she owned the town.<br>A motorcycle roared past, shearing the air and cutting off her thoughts. She looked up at the swaying old trees, suddenly feeling afraid. Her grandmother would have said &#x201c;kenina hora&#x201d; meaning, more or less, &#x201c;may the Evil Eye keep shut.&#x201d; In the Middle Ages, all good fortune would have routinely filled the recipients with dread, she comforted herself. One would have had to bang pots or compose and wear amulets to ward off the furies set loose by such joy as hers.<br>She took a deep breath, exhaling all bad thoughts, focusing. The caterer, then the florist. Check the hotel reservations at the Marriott for the out-of-town uncles and Adam&#x2019;s sister and brother-in-law. Check Printers Inc. for place cards and probably Grace After Meal booklets with a photo of the young couple, although Adam might be right in thinking that would be overkill, since they&#x2019;d have to be reordered for the wedding. But she wasn&#x2019;t feeling frugal.<br>They&#x2019;d moved up far in the world. From the salary of a lowly junior accountant to the earnings of their own accounting firm, whose clients headlined articles in Fortune magazine. It had taken a long time. Their eldest, Joshua, had just gotten into high school when they&#x2019;d finally bought their dream house, a historic colonial on a block of sought-after homes a short commute from downtown and Harvard. The renovation had taken years.<br>She turned the corner into Harvard Square. The students who rented out the smallest apartments had already taken up residence. They crowded the streets, their trim figures still in shorts and sleeveless tops, as if their defiance was enough to keep winter at bay.<br>She had been teaching high-school English for close to thirty-five years now. She liked young people. She liked looking at them: their bright, smooth, open faces, their supple, shapely bodies, their smiles. She liked their intelligent rebellion against forced compromises with conventional wisdom, often thinking that she learned as much as she taught. That, perhaps, had been her greatest fear about her profession: the bloody-mindedness as D. H. Lawrence&#x2014;that rebel against hypocrisy&#x2014;had called it; the repetitiveness of it all. The need to &#x201c;cover material,&#x201d; dulling the senses of the fresh enthusiastic human beings who, for the first time, were about to encounter a world of infinite wonders.<br>That had not happened, at least not too often. When she assigned Willa Cather&#x2019;s My Antonia, or Steinbeck&#x2019;s Grapes of Wrath, or The Diary of Anne Frank, she felt like a bystander to a thrilling event about to unfold before her very eyes. Sometimes, she admitted to herself sheepishly, she even felt a little like she&#x2019;d coauthored the book, deserving part of the credit for its wondrous qualities.<br>The kids were always such fresh challenges&#x2014;not unlike the books themselves. At the beginning of each new school year she felt as if she were peeling back the covers from their stiff bindings, each one a unique and fascinating story. She&#x2019;d begin her relationship with each one hopefully, hanging in there, looking for the good things until forced to admit otherwise. That did not happen often. If you looked hard enough and refused to give up hope long enough, you could always find something.<br>How lovely to be young and unwrinkled, with so many unspent days and months and years ahead! How lovely to have strong bones and white, glistening teeth straightened to perfection by expensive orthodontia. Her tongue navigated her own less-than-perfect smile. Some women her age got them straightened&#x2014;there were invisible braces nowadays, and porcelain veneers . . . But it seemed so vain and extravagant, not to mention bothersome. Besides, she had a man who had been telling her for the last forty years she was the most beautiful woman in the world.<br>She smiled to herself, waiting on the corner for the light to change.<br>The Body Shop window had cranberry-scented candles in little straw holders. But might it be too obvious to use a fall decorating scheme for the party? Pumpkins and squash, cranberries and apples? Adam would love it. Orange was his favorite color&#x2014;any shade. The kids often poked gentle fun at him for wardrobe disasters that could be chalked up to this enthusiasm. Since he never shopped unless forced to by dire necessity&#x2014;like running out of socks&#x2014;his purchases were often spontaneous impulses that overtook him when passing outlet stores with signs that read EVERYTHING REDUCED 70%. Inevitably, those drastic reductions included some article of men&#x2019;s apparel dyed a shocking&#x2014;and consequently unsalable&#x2014;shade of unbelievable orange: jackets, shirts, vests, ties, raincoats, even boots.<br>She shook her head. Goodwill always had a supply of excellent high-quality items in those shades courtesy of Adam Samuels. They hardly ever sold. Even poor people had some standards.<br>She walked into the shop, fingering the waxy shapes, breathing in the spicy smells. There was still time to make these decisions. So far Kayla had been very breezy &#x201c;whatever&#x201d; about the engagement party, except for defining the absolute parameters: Evening. Black tie. Top-notch catering. And one-twenty to one-fifty guests, max.<br>&#x201c;Abigail?&#x201d;<br>She turned her head. It was Sandra something, a woman she knew vaguely from synagogue functions; someone who wore strange, baggy designer clothes and had her hair cut brutally short. She and her husband were the kind of people who always wanted something: free tax advice, investment tips, donations for obscure causes, or to enlist you in time-consuming volunteer schemes that would make themselves look good. She smiled.<br>The woman put her arms around her, kissing her cheek: &#x201c;Mazal tov! I just heard. Wonderful about your daughter&#x2019;s engagement!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, how did you . . . ?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your friend Doris told me. So exciting!&#x201d;<br>Doris? &#x201c;Yes, thanks so much,&#x201d; Abigail said with an inward sigh, mentally adding her name and the vaguely remembered Doris&#x2019;s to a guest list already bloated with people she had to invite or risk insulting. Suddenly, when a party was in the offing, people seemed to sniff it out, ratcheting up their friendliness quotient to be included.<br>&#x201c;Well, see you in shul!&#x201d; Abigail waved, hurriedly leaving the store.<br>As she walked toward the caterer, Abigail felt herself tense. She hoped there wouldn&#x2019;t be a fight with Kayla, but there was no way she was going to insult Arthur Cohen (who was, after all, a fellow synagogue member and an old friend) by going elsewhere.<br>She remembered Adam&#x2019;s fiftieth birthday bash. Even though Abigail had done all the work, Kayla felt she had a right to decide the guest list. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want them. They are so boring,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, putting a line through Henrietta and Stephen.<br>They were old, old friends, people she and Adam had known from the first week they&#x2019;d moved to Boston. They had been to all each other&#x2019;s milestone celebrations, shared Sabbath evening dinners, planned joint vacations. They were like family.<br>&#x201c;But we were invited to Stephen&#x2019;s fiftieth!&#x201d; Abigail protested.<br>&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s such a bag of wind. And she&#x2019;s even worse . . .&#x201d; Kayla scrunched up her pretty nose in distaste. &#x201c;I thought we would just have&#x2014;you know&#x2014;the family,&#x201d; she continued, crossing off another two of their oldest friends.<br>Abigail said nothing but invited whom she pleased.<br>It was a surprise party. She&#x2019;d expected all the kids to arrange something special for Adam. Joshua, of course, did, preparing a heartfelt video in which he interviewed all their friends and relatives, putting together a lovely tribute. And Shoshana, even though she was eight months pregnant and had a toddler of two to look after, made all the flower arrangements, handwrote all the place cards, and baked hundreds of those sugar cookies she was famous for. Kayla, in contrast, breezed in the night of the party, an hour later than Abigail had asked her to come, wanting to know how she could help.<br>&#x201c;Nothing, darling. It&#x2019;s all been arranged. I&#x2019;m just so happy you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; Abigail smiled at her sweetly, swallowing hard. &#x201c;Daddy will be here soon.

Vladimir Nabokov--the �migr� author of <i>Lolita</i>;<i> Pale Fire</i>; and <i>Speak, Memory</i>--wrote his books first for himself, second for his wife, V�ra, and third for no one at all.<br><br>"Without my wife," he once noted, "I wouldn't have written a single novel." Set in prewar Europe and postwar America, spanning much of the century, the story of the Nabokovs' fifty-two-year marriage reads as vividly as a novel. V�ra, both beautiful and brilliant, is its outsized heroine--a woman who loves as deeply and intelligently as did the great romantic heroines of Austen and Tolstoy. Stacy Schiff's V�ra is a triumph of the biographical form.</p><p>She was wearing a black satin mask when they first met in 1923, and in a sense she wore a mask--that of the dutiful wife and helpmeet--throughout their 52-year marriage. Especially after the American publication of <i>Lolita</i> made her husband notorious in 1958, V�ra Nabokov's presence at her husband's side was crucial, writes her biographer Stacy Schiff: "[It] kept the fiction in its place, reassured readers ... that Nabokov's perversities were of a different kind." But V�ra Slonim (1902-91) was essential to Vladimir Nabokov's literary career from the beginning. She had a gift for handling practical matters that her spouse proudly lacked; she screened him from his publishers and his admirers with equal firmness, and in doing so she liberated him to fulfill the artistic genius they both believed he possessed. Praised for a previous biography of Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry, Schiff here cements her reputation as a literary biographer of striking subtlety and perceptiveness. She establishes a strong base in chapter 1 with her excellent analysis of V�ra Slonim's youth in a privileged Russian Jewish family in St. Petersburg. She then pursues her subject's elusive personality through hints in Nabokov's work and the comments of friends and colleagues. Schiff's elegant prose and eye for nuance nearly match Nabokov himself in this lucid, unsentimental portrait of a marriage. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><p>"When her 1991 New York Times obit called V�ra 'Wife, Muse, and Agent' it only hinted at her role, which is rescued from obscurity in Schiff's graceful prose." -- Publishers Weekly (starred review)</p> <br> <br></p><h2>The Super-Athletes: a Record of the Limits of Human Strength, Speed, and Stamina</h2><p>A unique record-book on feats of strength, speed, stamina, and skill.

Years ago, Mack escaped the past and started over at this hotel, and it has since become his life and his home; but though he has poured his heart and soul in the club, he knows that it will eventually pass not to him but to Cecily Elliott, the owners&#x2019; daughter. At eighteen, however, Cecily is wild and beautiful and increasingly desperate to break free on her own, even though she knows doing so will break her parents&#x2019; hearts. And this summer, as Bill&#x2019;s health begins to falter, all of the guests and staff of this esteemed island establishment can feel the storm coming that will change everything forever.</p><p>In <i>Summer People</i>, Beth, a recent widow, can barely keep things together; but she still decides that she must continue the family tradition of going to Nantucket, and fulfill a promise that her late husband Arch made before he died. Beth invites Marcus, the son of Arch&#x2019;s final and most challenging client, to spend the summer with her and her teenage twins, Winnie and Garrett.

Henty describes the army?s incredible journey through southern Europe and across the Alps in fascinating detail, providing both a lesson in ancient history and an absorbing story. The balance of power in Europe swayed between Rome and Carthage and the outcome of this struggle would determine the course of Western Civilization even until today.</p><p>G. A. Henty's has here woven an exciting adventure tale that will keep the young reader on the edge of his seat while, without being aware of it, the reader will be learning detailed information about the Punic Wars and the political climate in which they took place. This is the perfect way to awaken interest in history in young people and encourage them to learn more. <p>This book has also been enhanced with additional illustrations and new maps to aid the reader in the understanding of the text. </p><p>Recommended for Ages 10 and up.</p>Lost Classics is proud to bring you another of G. A. Henty's adventure stories for boys. Henty wrote his first book for young people in 1868. Its popularity spawned some eighty more. This is the third Henty novel on the Lost Classics list. Writing in World magazine George Grant reminisced about reading Henty as a child: "Whenever I ran across (a Henty book) in our local library I quickly checked it out, rushed home, and read itusually without putting it down." <p>The Young Carthaginian is a departure from the first two Henty books on the Lost Classics list. Set in ancient times during the Punic wars between Carthage and Rome, it follows the adventures of young Malchus, an officer in Hannibal's army. Henty describes the army's incredible journey crossing the Alps in fascinating detail providing both a lesson in ancient history and a can't-put-it-down story. </p><p>An exciting excerpt from The Young Carthaginian: </p><p>"After lying for a couple of hours Malchus rose to his feet, and issuing from the bushes looked round. He had resumed his armor and sword. As he stepped out a sudden shout arose, and he saw within a hundred yards of him a body of natives, some hundred strong, approaching. They had already caught sight of him. </p><p>"'Nessus,' he exclaimed, without looking round, 'lie still! I am seen, and shall be taken in a minute. It is hopeless for me to try to escape. You will do me more good by remaining hid and trying to free me from their hands afterward.' </p><p>"So saying, and without drawing his sword, Malchus quietly advanced toward the natives, who were rushing down toward him with loud shouts. Flight or resistance would be, as he had at once seen, hopeless, and it was only by present submission he could hope to save his life." </p><p>Valuable Bonus for Homeschoolers--Includes a Build-Your-Vocabulary Glossary of some 501 words.

I was told that I would have a table of fifteen in my section that night, and that they were serious foodies. Little did I expect Julia Child to be at the center of the table! I was terrified, having revered her for so many years expected her to be some sort of Olympian goddess. To my delight, she was incredibly down to earth, and extraordinarily appreciative of my service. After every plate of food and every new bottle of wine, she'd tell me how lovely everything was. At the end of the night, she told me I was lovely as well. It was one of the greatest tables of my lengthy career. Now, many years later, I'm the editor for this book. I doubt if she remembers the younger me, but I'll never forget her generosity, which she still has in abundance.<br>A.

His young life saw very little in material wealth, but an abundance of love and guidance. We didn't know we were poor, he said in his memoirs.Harris graduated magna cum laude from Cooley High School in Detroit in 1931 and went on to earn a diploma from Central Bible Institute (now College) in Springfield, Missouri, in 1937. He would add a bachelor's degree in 1961 and a master's degree in 1969, also from CBC.Harris pastored from 1936 to 1943, first Nichols (Missouri) Community Church, then Faith Tabernacle in Clio, Michigan. In 1943, he was selected as the first National Youth Leader for the Assemblies of God. During his tenure leading the A/G youth from the national headquarters in Springfield, Missouri (1943-1948), Harris founded the Speed the Light program in 1944�&#x20ac;&#x201d;-a missions program that focused on providing transportation, from bicycles to 4-wheel drive vehicles, to assist missionaries in the field. This program has grown exponentially over the decades. Last year, Speed the Light giving reached nearly $12 million.From 1948 through 1954, Harris pastored Fremont Tabernacle in Seattle, Washington. There he put his church on the map when in 1949 he and his church recruited 1,189 people to hand-write a chapter each of the Bible. Writers ranged from 8 to 85 years old and came from nearly 30 denominations. The local newspaper provided weekly updates concerning the progress and even President Truman sent a congratulatory note upon the Bible's completion. From that time on, people always referred to [us as] 'the church with the handwritten Bible, Harris said during an interview.In 1954, Harris was invited back to Springfield, Missouri, to become the editor in chief of A/G Church School Literature Department, which developed curriculum for Sunday School.

Compelled by this message, the wealthy, sybaritic Sextus Roscius goes not to his harlot, but to his doom&#x2014;savagely murdered by unknown assassins. In the unseasonable heat of a spring morning in 80 B.C., Gordianus the Finder is summoned to the house of Cicero, a young advocate staking his reputation on this case. The charge is patricide; the motive, a son's greed. The punishment, rooted deep in Roman tradition, is horrific beyond imagining.<br><br>Gordianus's investigation takes him through the city's raucous, pungent streets and deep into urban Umbria, unraveling layers of deceit, twisted passions, and murderous desperation. From pompous, rouged nobles to wily slaves to citizens of seemingly simple virtue, the case becomes a political nightmare. As the defense proceeds toward a devastating confrontation in the Forum, one man's fate may be threaten the very leaders of Rome itself.<br></p><p>My high school Latin teacher -- Sister Ethelreda, are you out there in cyberspace? -- enthralled her class for four years with her tales of ancient Rome, from culinary trivia to the deeds of the noble generals and the great Roman patriots. It was her hope, as she said, not only to teach us this beautiful language but to be able to bring to life for us the people who formed the vibrant culture that was Rome's. I heard an echo of her words many years later when I read THE FAR ARENA, in which the protagonist wished earnestly to be able to turn a doorknob in time and find the Roman behind the door.<br><br>With Steven Saylor's mysteries, we have that Roman behind the door. Set in ancient Rome before the rise of Julius Caesar, these are not your usual cozy reads. His detective, Gordianus the Finder, seems a scruffy sort, not a noble Roman from the history books by any means, and his Rome is a rough-and-tumble place full of noisy street vendors and con artists as well as more well-to-do, upstanding citizens, a city full of gossip and intrigue and nasty politics as vicious as anything we see today. The noble Romans do appear in his books, of course, but they're a far cry from the bloodless statues who watch serenely from the covers of Latin books as students painstakingly translate their dry speeches. Marcus Tullius Cicero, for one, appears in CATILINA'S RIDDLE not as a statesman but as an underhanded schemer obsessed with destroying Lucius Sergius Catilina, who has gone down in history, rightly or wrongly, as a man who attempted to bring down the Roman Republic.

Sextus Roscius is accused of killing his own father. This, in a society rife with deceit, betrayal, and conspiracy, where neither citizen nor slave can be trusted to speak the truth.

Now Shah takes us deeper into the heart of this exotic and magical land to uncover mysteries that have been hidden from Western eyes for centuries....<br><b><br></b>In this entertaining and penetrating book, Tahir sets out on a bold new journey across Morocco that becomes an adventure worthy of the mythical <b>Arabian Nights</b>. <br><br>As he wends his way through the labyrinthine medinas of Fez and Marrakesh, traverses the Sahara sands, and tastes the hospitality of ordinary Moroccans, Tahir collects a dazzling treasury of traditional stories, gleaned from the heritage of <i>A Thousand and</i> <i>One Nights</i>. The tales, recounted by a vivid cast of characters, reveal fragments of wisdom and an oriental way of thinking that is both enthralling and fresh. A link in the chain of scholars and teachers who have passed these stories down for centuries like a baton in a relay race, Shah reaches layers of culture that most visitors hardly realize exist, and eventually discovers the story living in his own heart. <br><br>Along the way he describes the colors, characters, and the passion of Morocco, and comes to understand why it is such an enchanting land. From master masons who labor only at night to Sufi wise men who write for soap operas, and Tuareg guides afflicted by reality TV, <b>In Arabian Nights</b> takes us on an unforgettable journey, shining a light on facets of a society that are normally left in darkness.</p><p>Tahir Shah was born into an Anglo-Afghan family with roots in the mountain stronghold of the Hindu Kush. His eleven books have chronicled a series of fabulous journeys. He lives with his wife and two children in Casablanca.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><i><br>Be in the world, but not of the world.</i>&#x2014;Arab Proverb<br><br>The torture room was ready for use. There were harnesses for hanging the prisoners upside down, rows of sharp-edged batons, and smelling salts, used syringes filled with dark liquids and worn leather straps, tourniquets, clamps, pliers, and equipment for smashing the feet. On the floor there was a central drain, and on the walls and every surface, dried blood&#x2013;plenty of it. I was manacled, hands pushed high up my back, stripped almost naked, with a military-issue blindfold tight over my face. I had been in the torture chamber every night for a week, interrogated hour after hour on why I had come to Pakistan.<br><br>All I could do was tell the truth: that I was traveling through en route from India to Afghanistan, where I was planning to make a documentary about the lost treasure of the Mughals. My film crew and I had been arrested on a residential street, and taken to the secret torture installation known by the jailers as "The Farm."<br><br>I tried to explain to the military interrogator that we were innocent of any crime. But for the military police of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, a British citizen with a Muslim name, coming overland from an enemy state&#x2013;India&#x2013;set off all the alarms.<br><br>Through nights of blindfolded interrogation, with the screams of other prisoners forming an ever-present backdrop to life in limbo, I answered the same questions again and again: What was the real purpose of my journey? What did I know of Al-Qaeda bases across the border in Afghanistan and even, why was I married to an Indian? It was only after the first week that the blindfolds were removed and, as my eyes adjusted to the blaring interrogation lamps, I caught my first burnt-out glimpse of the torture room.<br><br>The interrogations took place at night, although day and night were much the same at The Farm. The strip-light high on the ceiling of my cell was never turned off. I would crouch there, waiting for the sound of keys and for the thud of feet pacing over stone. That meant they were coming for me again. I would brace myself, say a prayer, and try to clear my mind. A clear mind is a calm one.<br>The keys would jingle once more and the bars to my cell would swing open just enough for a hand to reach through and grab me.<br><br>First the blindfold and then the manacles.<br><br>Shut out the light, and your other senses compensate. I could hear the muffled screeches of a prisoner being tortured in the parallel block and taste the dust out in the fields on my tongue. <br>Most of the time, I squatted in my cell, learning to be alone. Get locked up in solitary in a foreign land, with the threat of immediate execution hanging over you, a blade dangling from a thread, and you try to pass the time by forgetting where you are.<br><br>First I read the graffiti on the walls. Then I read it again, and again, until I was half-mad. Pens and paper were forbidden, but previous inmates had used their ingenuity. They had scrawled slogans in their own blood and excrement. I found myself desperate to make sense of others' madness. Then I knelt on the cement floor and slowed my breathing, even though I was so scared words could not describe the fear.<br><br>Real terror is a crippling experience. You sweat so much that your skin goes all wrinkly like when you've been in the bath all afternoon. And then the scent of your sweat changes. It smells like cat pee, no doubt from the adrenaline. However hard you wash, it won't come off. It smothers you, as your muscles become frozen with acid and your mind paralyzed by despair.<br><br>The only hope of staying sane was to think of my life, the life that had become separated from me, and to imagine that I was stepping into it again . . . into the dream that, until so recently, had been my reality.<br><br>The white walls of my cell were a kind of silver screen on which I projected the Paradise to which I longed to return. The love for that home and all within washed out the white walls, the blood-graffiti, and the stink of fear. And the more I feared, the more I forced myself to think of my adopted Moroccan home, Dar Khalifa, the Caliph's House.<br><br>There were courtyards brimming with fountains and birdsong, and gardens in which Timur and Ariane, my little son and daughter, played with their tortoises and their kites. There was bright summer sunlight, and fruit trees, and the sound of my wife, Rachana's, voice, calling the children in to lunch. And there were lemon-colored butterflies, scarlet red hibiscus flowers, blazing bougainvillea, and the hum of bumblebees dancing through the honeysuckle. <br><br>Hour after hour I would watch my memories screened across the blank walls. I would be blinded by the colors, and glimpse in sharp detail the lives we had created for ourselves on the edge of Casablanca. With my future now in the balance, all I could do was to pray. Pray that I might be reunited with that life, a melodious routine of innocence interleaved with gentle calamity.<br>As the days and nights in solitary passed, I moved through the labyrinth of my memories. I set myself the task of finding every memory, every fragment of recollection.<br><br>They began with my childhood, and with the first moment I ever set foot on Moroccan soil.<br>The ferry had taken us from southern Spain, across the Strait of Gibraltar. It was the early seventies. Tucked up in the northwest corner of Africa, Tangier was a melange of life like none other. There were beatniks and tie-dyed hippies, drug dealers and draft dodgers, writers, poets, fugitives, and philosophers. They were all united in a swirling stew of humanity. I was only five years old, but I can remember it crystal clear, a world I could never hope to understand. It was scented with orange blossom, illuminated by sunshine so bright that I had to squint.<br><br>My father, who was from Afghanistan, had been unable to take my sisters and me to his homeland. It was too dangerous. So he brought us on frequent journeys to Morocco instead. I suppose it was a kind of Oriental logic. The two countries are remarkably similar, he would say: dramatic landscapes, mountain and desert, a tribal society steeped in history, rigid values, and a code of honor, all arranged on a canvas of vibrant cultural color.<br><br>The animated memories of those early travels were relived on the whitewashed walls of solitary, mile by mile. As I watched them, I found myself thinking about the stories my father told as the wheels beneath us turned through the dust, and how they bridged the abyss between fact and fantasy.<br>The interrogations in the torture room came and went, as did the jangle of keys, the plates of thin soupy daal slipped under the bars, and the nightmares. Through it all, I watched the walls, my concentration fixed on the matinees and the late night shows that slipped across them. With time, I found I could navigate through weeks and years I had almost forgotten took place, and could remember details that my eyes had never quite revealed. I revisited my first day at prep school, my first tumble from a tree-climbing childhood, and the day I almost burned down my parents' house.<br>But most of all, I remembered the tales my father told.<br><br>I pictured him rubbing a hand over his dark mustache and down over his chin, and the words that were the bridge into another world:<br><br>"Once upon a time . . ."<br><br>Sometimes the fear would descend over me like a veil. I would feel myself slipping into a kind of trance, numbed by the frantic debauched screams of the prisoner being worked over in the torture room. In the same way that a bird in the jaws of a predator readies itself for the end, I would push the memories out, struggle to find silence. It only came when the uncertainty and the fear reached its height. And with it came a voice. It would ease me, calm me, weep with me, and speak from inside me, not from my head, but from my heart. <br><br>In a whisper the voice guided me to my bedroom at the Caliph's House. The windows were open, the curtains swaying, and the room filled with the swish of the wind in the eucalyptus trees outside. <br>There is something magical about the sound, as if it spans emptiness between restraint and the furthest reaches of the mind. I listened hard, concentrating to the hum of distant waves and to the rustle of crisp eucalyptus leaves, and walked down through the house and out onto the terrace. Standing there, the ocean breeze cool on my face, I sensed the tingle of something I could not understand, and saw a fine geometric carpet laid over the lawn. I strolled down over the terrace and onto the grass, and stepped aboard it, the silk knots pressing against my bare feet. Before I knew it, we were away, floating up into the air.<br><br>We moved over the Atlantic without a sound, icy waters surging, cresting, breaking. Gradually, we gathered speed and height until I could see the curve of the earth below. We crossed deserts and mountains, oceans and endless seas. The carpet folded back its edge, protecting me from the wind.<br>After hours of flight, I glimpsed the outline of a city ahead. It was ink-black and sleeping, its minarets soaring up to the heavens, its domed roofs hinting at treasures within. The carpet banked to the left and descended until we were hovering over a grand central square. It was teeming with people and life, illuminated by ten thousand blazing torches, their flames licking the night.<br><br>A legion of soldiers in gilded armor was standing guard. Across from them were stallions garlanded in fine brocades, elephants fitted with howdahs, a pen of prowling tigers, and, beside it, a jewel-encrusted carousel. There were oxen roasting on enormous spits, tureens of mutton stewed in milk, platters of brazed camel meat, and great silver salvers heaped with rice and with fish.<br>A sea of people were feasting, entertained by jugglers and acrobats, serenaded by the sound of a thousand flutes. Nearby, on a dais crafted from solid gold, overlaid with rare carpets from Samarkand, sat the king. His bulky form was adorned ...</p><h2>Lifelike Drawing In Colored Pencil With Lee Hammond</h2><p><b>Real life happens in color!</b><br><br>Colored pencils are wonderful tools for creating realistic drawings. <b>Lee Hammond</b>, popular instructor and North Light author of more than twenty instructional books on drawing and painting, is here to show you how.

Are you desperately overcommitted, afraid to say no? Do you have fang marks from being bled dry by energy vampires? Does the onslaught of violence in the news leave you drained? If so, you're the victim of a hidden energy crisis. To resolve it you need more than traditional solutions such as eating well, getting a good night&#x2019;s sleep, and exercising. Here at last is the complete prescription to stop you from feeling constantly drained and enables you to live a more vibrant life: the Positive Energy Program created by Judith Orloff, M.D.<br><br>Dr. Orloff is the pioneer behind Energy Psychiatry, a new field that addresses the subtle energetic components of health and behavior. Energy Psychiatry blends the practice of mainstream medicine with an emerging scientific understanding of subtle energies, revered by many cross-cultural healing traditions as our life force. In <b>Positive Energy</b>, Dr. Orloff explains this exciting new discipline and how it led her to formulate ten essential prescriptions for boosting energy, improving relationships, and combating energy vampires. The prescriptions are:<br><br>� Awaken your intuition and rejuvenate yourself--and learn the cure for technodespair and overload from emails, computers, and phones<br>� Find a nurturing spiritual path that fits your own beliefs and inner stirrings<br>� Design an energy-aware approach to diet, exercise, and health--and learn how to avoid the "energetic overeating" that sabotages attempts to lose weight<br>� Generate positive emotional energy to counter negativity<br>� Develop a heart-centered sexuality<br>� Open yourself to the flow of creativity and inspiration to achieve greater joy<br>� Celebrate the sacredness of laughter, pampering, and the replenishment of retreat--it&#x2019;s not selfish to take care of yourself<br>� Discover how to attract positive people and situations<br>� Protect yourself from energy vampires with specific <br> shielding techniques <br>� Create abundance and a continuing flow of energy<br><br>The purpose of this program is to make your life easier. Each prescription has clear instructions for practicing the simple, powerful exercises Dr. Orloff gives her patients and uses herself--plus, there&#x2019;s a "Treat Yourself" section to help you relax and enjoy the program&#x2019;s full benefits. Following each chapter are Dr. Orloff&#x2019;s interviews with luminaries who share their personal secrets about how they use a specific prescription to generate more energy. You'll discover how Quincy Jones&#x2019;s intuition opened up after brain surgery, Larry King honed his interviewing techniques, Naomi Judd recovered from hepatitis C, and Jamie Lee Curtis deals with draining people.<br><br>Dr. Orloff says, "We can't stop the negative circumstances of our time--our cell phones will keep ringing, e-mails will keep coming, people will be rude, our children will be demanding, and bad things will happen in the world. But we can learn ways to protect our energy so that we can stay centered in dealing with the stresses that arise." <b>Positive Energy </b>shows you how to slow down time to match your natural rhythms, allowing you to be fully present for your life. Learning this can make the difference between an exuberant life and one you're always recovering from. Filled with Dr. Orloff's warmth, humor, and compassion, <b>Positive Energy</b> is your tool kit for transforming fatigue, stress, and fear into an abundance of vibrance, strength, and love.</p><p>JUDITH ORLOFF, M.D., a psychiatrist and practicing intuitive, is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA. She is the author of the bestsellers <b>Dr. Judith Orloff&#x2019;s Guide to Intuitive Healing</b> and <b>Second Sight</b>.

Intuition brings magic to traditional wellness approaches, but also opens you to the intriguing realm of energy fields--vibes that radiate from people, places, plants, the night sky. Think of the contagious electric buzz of Tokyo or Rome; the mellow, cool groove of Coltrane's sax; or the orgasmic surge of applause at Yankee Stadium when the home team wins. Each day you'll encounter a wonderfully diverse but often unacknowledged range of energies. In this prescription you'll see how intuition registers them and sharpens your sensitivity to your life force's fire, showing ways to metabolize and protect it. By awakening your intuition, you can access your full energy. This is the true secret of secrets: I won't be satisfied with anything less and hope you won't either.<br><br>As a specialist in Energy Psychiatry, and personally, I worship my high-octane intuitions: I owe the blessing of becoming a physician to one. However, at twenty, when an unwavering inner voice told me I was going to medical school, it was the last thing I thought I wanted. Yes, I was the only child of two physician parents with twenty-five physicians in my family, from cancer researchers to gynecologists, a lineage I seemed ordained to join. But I'd never liked science, would get bored around my parents' doctor friends. At the time I was a hippie living in an old converted brick Laundromat with my muralist boyfriend in Venice Beach. I worked in the May Company's towel department. Still, as my intuition sank in, it gave me tremendous energy. So, dubiously, I enrolled in one course in a junior college just to see. One course became two, became . . . fourteen years of medical training--a trek that would've pushed Indiana Jones to the edge. But my intuition had staying power, provided all the oomph needed to propel me to my calling.<br><br>Similarly blessed, my patient Laura literally owes her life to an intuition about energy. A math teacher with moxie, at forty-five she began experiencing a terrible pounding in her ear, diagnosed by a top neurologist as a routine recurring migraine. Despite his reassurance, she kept feeling "an energy like a train roaring through my body screaming something was wrong." As I heard the dire immediacy of this intuitive warning, I convulsed with chills. I was very afraid for Laura; she had to act. At my urging, Laura sought a second opinion.<br><br>I'm all for protesting when something doesn't feel right. It's foolish, even reckless to ignore such energy signals. An angiogram was ordered; dangerous blockages in her cerebral arteries were found. This new doctor told her: "The good news is you didn't have a stroke or die. The bad news is you have fibromuscular dysplasia. You'll need surgery to keep your arteries from collapsing." Arteries collapsing? Of course, Laura was terrified, but also relieved to have a possible solution. Then, the medical machine kicked into high gear. Laura's emergency brain surgery both cured her symptoms and saved her life. For a year, her angiograms have been fine. Now, Laura listens to her intuition like a fiend. She and her doctor agree: doubting it would have proven lethal.<br><br>In my Energy Psychiatry practice I advocate a "take no prisoners" style of intuition. This gut-centered voice is committed to your happiness, health, and survival. With practice, you can learn to tune into it. I want you to start listening. Really listening. I guarantee: your positive energy will grow. Why? You'll be operating from a spot inside that's juicy, core-felt, authentic--not from an impulse to conform or disown your strength. You won't be seduced by what may look good but betrays your gut. Intuition is a truth detector. When you deviate even a nanofraction from your inner voice, your energy will wane, whether a subtle seepage or radical bottoming out. The more ferociously faithful you are to this truth, the more energized you'll be.<br><br>Intuition offers a direct line to your life force and also, as I experience it, to a divine intelligence. It's the language of energy. You need to speak it to thrive, though our techno-crazed society doesn't recognize this essential fact. At best it equates intuition with a woman's trait (try telling that to Native American male shamans!). At worst, it's considered a magic trick or fluff. No surprise there's an epidemic of worn-down, confused people out there.<br><br>Our energy issues are solvable, but we can't afford to remain deaf to intuition's messages. Its expertise is energy; its job is to know every nuance of what makes you tick. A master at reading vibes, intuition is constantly tallying: what gives you positive energy, what dissipates it. Your intuition evaluates who you meet, where you go, your job, your family, current events--all crucial data this program will show you how to interpret and apply.<br><br>As an Energy Psychiatrist, I train patients and workshop participants to tune into vibes, a skill you'll learn. I've watched thousands of people do it. Consider Gloria, who's driven a sixteen-wheeler for thirty years: "I can sense the bad vibes of someone's road rage and maneuver around the aggravation." Or Janet, a homicide detective: "By shielding my energy, I'm not emotionally destroyed by gruesome crimes." My friend serving in an elite naval team in Afghanistan told me, "An effective point man catfooting behind enemy lines has to use 'Spidy Sense,' like Spider-Man does. It means reading energy, attending to internal alarms beyond the five senses." Whatever your field, you'll benefit from intuiting energy too. Get ready to put the Positive Energy Program's First Prescription into action.<br>GET IN SYNC WITH YOUR LIFE<br>Think of yourself as a spy whose mission is to detect how much in tune you really are with your life--the big picture and the details. Unlike more cerebral methods, intuition offers you the edge of having X-ray vision into all energy matters. Whether revealing the hard truth about toxic relationships, your exhaustion level, or a thankless job, intuition is always trying to communicate, though you may not hear. It resides in a quiet place obscured by the chatter of everyday thoughts. I will take you there.<br><br>Prepare to raise your antennae. You're constantly having intuitions about energy, but may not realize it. Suddenly, bam! A gut feeling, goose bumps, or a flash affirm what fuels or depletes you. Intuitions can be positive. For instance, you'll feel a burst of aliveness, clarity, or tension lifting about a new project. Or negative--your skin crawls or you wilt at the prospect of a sleazy business deal. In the Positive Energy Program, you'll get in the habit of intuitively tracking your energy response. (Mine soars around full moons, puppies, and during uninterrupted days of writing alone, but shrinks at the thought of black-tie events, greasy food, and fast talkers.) As I do and teach my patients, you'll identify information that zings and feels right. By noticing your energy's fluctuations, you'll get a jump on where you're off-center--in relationships, health, and career--so you can change.<br><br>Intuition also involves picking up vibes. People and situations can give off welcoming positive energy that invigorates, or oppressive negative energy that repels. Our colloquial language reflects these intuitions. One patient affectionately calls his gangly, six-foot-five brother a "tall drink of water"; another says, "My boss shoots daggers with his eyes." Sensing vibes provides instinctual gauges of your comfort level.<br>Techniques for Sensing Positive and Negative Energy<br><br>In the mid-eighties when I'd just begun to expand my traditional psychiatric practice to include intuition and energy, I did plenty of experimenting. My good buddy for the first few years of this exploration was Michael Crichton, filmmaker, author, and Harvard M.D. A towering six foot nine, Michael has a wicked mix of intellect and humor with a cynical edge. For me, he was the perfect companion to investigate a dimension of health I'd never heard of in medical school: our body's subtle energy system.<br><br>My world has never been the same, this was my initiation into Energy Psychiatry. I want to share with you our discoveries, and what I've been learning since. Being able to sense and direct our life force gets positive energy going: we exude it, attract it, and can read it in others. Our subtle system is the engine that drives well-being. Acupuncture activates energy by placing tiny needles in meridian points in the body. So does exchanging good vibes with people. First, I'll teach you what energy feels like, a sublime experience that intuition conveys. You may perceive it as colors, light, or positive and negative vibes. This program makes real for you what Energy Psychiatry is based on: that our bodies and spirits are microsystems of energy, and that health is about balance, which intuition helps us achieve.<br><br>Friends can be the best coconspirators in charting the unknown. Michael and I set out to experience energy, a real adventure given our "rational" medical backgrounds. We were the blind leading the blind, but so curious. Here's what we did, an exercise you'll try later: I'd lie on my back on the floor as Michael placed his palm about two feet from my head. Slowly he'd edge closer until he described feeling "a distinct contour of warmth" inches above me--the halo depicted in sacred art. We all have halos, not just angels. Michael used the same sensing technique to outline my energy field from head to toe. Starting a few feet away, he'd move his palm nearer until he definitely felt warmth, tingling, quivering or pressure, marking an invisible energy border inches to a foot from my body. Then we'd switch places, and I'd practice with him. Michael describes this process in his autobiogr...</p><h2>Make Your Own Patterns</h2><p><p>With this guide to patternmaking, it&#x2019;s easier than ever to design a pleasing wardrobe, replace worn-out garments, and adapt clothing to changes in body shape.

Expanses of pastureland, and even the occasional cactus, a stranger to the high country, a misplaced wayfarer, there by mistake.</p><p> </p><p>Like her.</p><p> </p><p>A flash of resentment rose suddenly within Sierra, and a moment or two passed before she recognized the emotion for what it was: not her own opinion, but that of her late father, Hank Breslin.</p><p> </p><p>When it came to the McKettricks, Sierra <i>had</i> no opinions that she could honestly claim, because she didn't know these people, except by reputation.</p><p> </p><p>She'd taken their name for one reason and one reason only-- because that was part of the deal.

She stood in silence for a long moment, listening to the rattle-throated hum of the station wagon's engine, the lonely cry of a nearby bird, the thrum of blood in her ears. A piney scent spiced the air.</p><p> </p><p>Sierra turned, saw the marble angels marking the graves of Angus McKettrick's wives--Georgia, mother of Rafe, Kade and Jeb. Concepcion, mother of Kate.</p><p> </p><p><i>Look for Holt and Lorelei,</i> Eve had told her, the last time they'd spoken over the telephone. <i>That's our part of the family.</i></p><p> </p><p>Sierra caught sight of other bronze statues, smaller than Angus's but no less impressive in their detail. They were works of art, museum pieces, and if they hadn't been solidly anchored in cement, they probably would have been stolen. It said something about the McKettrick legend, she supposed, that there had been no vandalism in this lonely, wind-blown place.</p><p> </p><p>Jeb McKettrick, the youngest of the brothers, was represented by a cowboy with his six-gun drawn; his wife, Chloe, by a slender woman in pioneer dress, shading her eyes with one hand and smiling. Their children, grandchildren, great-and a few great-great-grandchildren surrounded them, their costly headstones laid out in neat rows, like the streets of a western town.</p><p> </p><p>Next was Kade McKettrick, easy in his skin, wearing a six-shooter, like his brother, but with an open book in his hand. His wife, Mandy, wore trousers, a loose-fitting shirt, boots and a hat, and held a shotgun. Like Chloe, she was smiling. Judging by the number of other graves around theirs, these two had also been prolific parents.</p><p> </p><p>The statue of Rafe McKettrick revealed a big, powerfully built man with a stubborn set to his jaw. His bride, Emmeline, stood close against his side; their arms were linked and she rested her head against the outside of his upper arm.</p><p> </p><p>Sierra smiled. Again, their progeny was plentiful. The last statue brought up an unexpected surge of emotion in Sierra. Here, then, was Holt, half brother to Rafe, Kade and Jeb, and to Kate. In his long trail coat, he looked both handsome and tough. A pair of very detailed ammunition belts criss-crossed his chest, and the badge pinned to his wide lapel read, "Texas Ranger."</p><p> </p><p>Sierra stared into those bronze eyes and, once again, felt something stir deep inside her. I came from this man, she thought. We've got the same DNA.</p><p> </p><p>Liam gave a jarring blast of the car horn, impatient to get to the ranch house that would be their home for the next twelve months.</p><p> </p><p>Sierra waved in acknowledgment but moved on to the statue of Lorelei. She was mounted on a mule, long, lace-trimmed skirts spilling on either side of her impossibly small waist, face shadowed, not by a sunbonnet but by a man's hat. Her spirited gaze rested lovingly on her husband, Holt.</p><p> </p><p>Liam laid on the horn.</p><p> </p><p>Fearing he might decide to take the wheel and drive to the ranch house on his own, Sierra turned reluctantly from the markers and followed a path littered with pine needles and the dead leaves of the six towering white oaks that shared the space, heading back to the car.</p><p> </p><p>Back to her son. "Are all the McKettricks <i>dead?</i>" Liam asked, when Sierra settled into the driver's seat and fastened the belt.</p><p> </p><p>"No," Sierra answered, waiting for some stray part of herself to finish meandering among those graves, making the acquaintance of ancestors, and catch up. "<i>We're</i> McKettricks, and we're not dead. Neither is your grandmother, or Meg." She knew there were cousins, too, descended from Rafe, Kade and Jeb, but it was too big a subject to explain to a seven-year-old boy. Besides, she was still trying to square them all away in her own mind.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought my name was Liam <i>Breslin,</i>" the little boy said practically.</p><p> </p><p>It should have been Liam Douglas, Sierra thought, remembering her first and only lover. As always, when Liam's father, Adam, came to mind, she felt a pang, a complicated mixture of passion, sorrow and helpless fury. She and Adam had never been married, so she'd given Liam her maiden name.</p><p> </p><p>"We're McKettricks now," Sierra said with a sigh. "You'll understand when you're older."</p><p> </p><p>She backed the car out carefully, keenly aware of the steep descent on all sides, and made the wide turn that would take them back on to the network of dirt roads bisecting the Triple M.</p><p> </p><p>"I can understand <i>now,</i>" Liam asserted, having duly pondered the matter in his solemn way. "After all, I'm <i>gifted.</i>"</p><p> </p><p>"You may be gifted," Sierra replied, concentrating on her driving, "but you're still seven."</p><p> </p><p>"Do I get to be a cowboy and ride bucking broncs and stuff like that?"</p><p> </p><p>Sierra suppressed a shudder. "No," she said. "That bites," Liam answered, folding his arms and settling deeper into the heavy nylon coat she'd bought him on the road, when they'd reached the first of the cold-weather states. "What's the good of living on a ranch if you can't be a cowboy?"</p><p> </p><p>The elderly station wagon banged into the yard, bald tires crunching half-thawed gravel, and came to an obstreperous stop. Travis Reid paused behind the horse trailer hitched to Jesse McKettrick's mud-splattered black truck, pushed his hat to the back of his head with one leather-gloved finger and grinned, waiting for something to fall off the rig. Nothing did, which just went to prove that the age of miracles was not past.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse appeared at the back of the trailer, leading old Baldy by his halter rope. "Who's that?" he asked, squinting in the wintry late afternoon sunshine.</p><p> </p><p>Travis spared him no more than a glance. "A long-lost relative of yours, unless I miss my guess," he said easily.</p><p> </p><p>The station wagon belched some smoke and died. Travis figured it for a permanent condition. He looked on with interest as a good-looking woman climbed out from behind the wheel, looked the old car over, and gave the driver's-side door a good kick with her right foot.</p><p> </p><p>She was a McKettrick, all right. Of the female persuasion, too. Jesse left Baldy standing to jump down from the bed of the trailer and lower the ramp to the ground. "Meg's half sister?" he asked. "The one who grew up in Mexico with her crazy, drunken father?"</p><p> </p><p>"Reckon so," Travis said. He and Meg communicated regularly, most often by e-mail, and she'd filled him in on Sierra as far as she could. Nobody in the family knew her very well, including her mother, Eve, so the information was sparse. She had a seven-y...</p></p><h2>One Thousand White Women</h2><p>One Thousand White Women is the story of May Dodd and a colorful assembly of pioneer women who, under the auspices of the U.S. government, travel to the western prairies in 1875 to intermarry among the Cheyenne Indians. The covert and controversial &#34;Brides for Indians&#34; program, launched by the administration of Ulysses S. Grant, is intended to help assimilate the Indians into the white man&#39;s world. Toward that end May and her friends embark upon the adventure of their lifetime. Jim Fergus has so vividly depicted the American West that it is as if these diaries are a capsule in time.</p><p>WINNER OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS BOOKSELLERS AWARD<p> "Jim Fergus's <i>One Thousand White Women</i> is a splendid, fresh, and engaging novel. Strikingly original." --Jim Harrison, author of <i>Legends of the Fall</i></p><p> "A most impressive novel that melds the physical world to the spiritual. <i>One Thousand White Women</i> is engaging, entertaining, well-written, and well-told. It will be widely read for a long time, as will the rest of Jim Fergus's work." --Rick Bass, author of <i>Where the Sea Used to Be</i></p><p> "Jim Fergus knows his country in a way that's evocative of Dee Brown and all the other great writers of the American West and its native peoples. But <i>One Thousand White Women</i> is more than a chronicle of the Old West. It's a superb tale of sorrow, suspense, exultation, and triumph that leaves the reader waiting to turn the page and wonderfully wrung out at the end." --Winston Groom, author of <i>Forrest Gump</i></p><p> "The best writing transports readers to another time and place, so that when they reluctantly close the book, they are astonished to find themselves returned to their everyday lives. <i>One Thousand White Women</i> is such a book. Jim Fergus so skillfully envelopes us in the heart and mind of the main character, May Dodd, that we weep when she mourns, we shake our fist at anyone who tries to sway her course, and our hearts pound when she is in danger." --<i>Colorado Springs Gazette</i></p><p> "An impressive historical...terse, convincing, and affecting." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>A Selection of the Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club <p>" I leave this record for my dear children, in the event that they never see their loving mother again and so that they might one day know the truth of my unjust incarceration, my escape from Hell, and into whatever is to come in these pages..." from the journals of May Dodd </p><p>Based on an actual historical event but told through fictional diaries, this is the story of a remarkable woman who travels west in 1975 and marries the chief of the Cheyenne Nation. </p><p>One Thousand White Women begins with May Dodd's journey west, into the unknown. Yet the unknown is a far better fate than the life she left behind: committed to an insane asylum by her blueblood family for the crime of loving a man beneath her station, May finds that her only hope of freedom is to participate in a secret government program whereby women from the "civilized" world become the brides of Cheyenne warriors. What follows is the story of May's breathtaking adventures: her brief, passionate romance with the gallant young army captain John Bourke; her marriage to the great chief Little Wolf; and her conflict of being caught between two worlds, loving two men, living two lives. </p><p>So vividly has Jim Fergus depicted the American West that May Dodd's journals are like a capsule in time.</p></p><h2>Birds of Michigan Field Guide (Bird Identification Guides)</h2><p>Make bird watching in Michigan even more enjoyable!

Reprint.</p><p>Amid his efforts to expose the Russian mob, Robert I. Friedman learned from the FBI that "the most brilliant and savage Russian mob organization in the world" had put a $100,000 price on his head. Reading <i>Red Mafiya</i>, it's not hard to see why: this is a brave book about a troubling subject. Friedman, a freelance journalist, describes the research behind it: "I ventured into the Russians' gaudy strip clubs in Miami Beach; paid surprise visits to their well-kept suburban homes in Denver; interviewed hit men and godfathers in an array of federal lockups; and traveled halfway around the world trying to make sense of their tangled criminal webs, which have ensnared everyone from titans of finance and the heads of government to entire state security services." Their racket involves heroin smuggling, weapons trafficking, mass extortion, and casino operation, among other activities. "Blending financial sophistication with bone-crunching violence, the Russian mob has become the FBI's most formidable criminal adversary, creating an international criminal colossus that has surpassed the Colombian cartels, the Japanese Yakuzas, the Chinese triads, and the Italian Mafia in wealth and weaponry," writes Friedman. They've even penetrated professional hockey, as Friedman shows in an eye-opening chapter ("Federal authorities have come to fear that the NHL is now so compromised by Russian gangsters that the integrity of the game itself may be in jeopardy"). <p> <i>Red Mafiya</i> benefits from a breezy narrative in detailing a master criminal operation whose influence on the United States is growing rapidly. Russian mobsters already have siphoned off millions of dollars in foreign aid meant to prop up their country's economy--and they may have a more direct impact on American national security concerns in the years ahead: "The Russian mob virtually controls their nuclear-tipped former superpower," writes Friedman. Now, there's a scary thought. Lifting the Iron Curtain seems to have been a mixed blessing: it let freedom in, and organized crime out. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>This disturbing, sharply rendered account tells how the post-Communist Russian Mafiya has infiltrated American life with tactical intelligence and a rare level of viciousness. Drawing from interviews with top Russian mobsters and police, journalist Friedman (Zealots for Zion: Inside Israel's West Bank Settlement Movement) trenchantly explores the brutal corruption of the U.S.S.R. and the anarchic greed that has flourished since its collapse, incubating a "criminal colossus that has surpassed the Colombian cartels, the Japanese Yakuzas, the Chinese triads and the Italian Mafia in wealth and weaponry." Friedman, whose reporting on this subject has appeared in Vanity Fair, the Village Voice and other publications, writes of one wise guy responsible for 100 hits and of "Tarzan"Dthe swaggering Miami mobster busted while attempting to tender a Russian submarine to Colombian drug lords. Friedman documents how the mobsters have imported their brand of terror tacticsDshakedowns, kidnappings, bombings and public assassinationDfrom Moscow to Russian communities in Denver, Brooklyn's Brighton Beach and elsewhere, and examines what he casts as the largely inadequate, uninformed responses by law enforcement. Perhaps most disturbing, he suggests, is this: following profitable 1980s-era gasoline bootlegging schemes, Mafiya criminals shrewdly expanded into numerous quasi-legal pursuitsDestablishing luxurious Russian-themed nightclubs, corrupting Russian migr ice hockey players and making inroads in Israel through their own Jewish ethnicity. Friedman isn't always in control of the bewildering array of players and narrative threads that make up his complicated tale. But there's much to praise in this frightening, urgent reportorial projectDa project that has resulted in death threats against Friedman, as he relates in his hair-raising introduction.

Each essay responds to a question, such as "Who runs the switchboard? Is there a God?" Wise then writes an answer, such as, "There is no grand puppeteer moving you around by invisible strings. The creative Source endows all energy with the self-governing power of integral intelligence. Every value in the Universe, and therefore every Being in the Universe, is interactive and interdependent in one integrated circuit."<p> If this seems like woo-woo gobbledy-gook, read no further. But if there is a spark that ignites your attention, be prepared for a book that explores intuition, quantum physics, the energy of chi, and "essential values" all in one sweeping breath. Like a Carlos Castaneda or Stephen Hawking book, <i>Letter to Earth</i> should be digested slowly. It also requires you to check your skepticism at the door. This is a writer who eloquently preaches to the New Age choir, addressing questions like, who's dreaming when you are asleep, and where are you when you are dreaming? What is d�j� vu? "If you are seeking answers, you need to ask questions and be available to receive a response--wherever it may come from," writes Wise. "It could come from the grocer, the radio, the garden or the Cosmos." And for many it could come from this unique teacher. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>The Publisher wants you to know... LETTER TO EARTH has these sterling reviews: <p>LIBRARY JOURNAL, says: "Prefaced by a letter to her three-year-old daughter, to whom the author bequeaths her unorthodox wisdom, these writings explore several immense questions, such as "How can humanity free its children from the patterns of the past?" and "What can be done to change the world?" The answers that emerge are extraordinary and inspiring, grounded in "New Science," a field of thought that takes into account the transformational role of consciousness in all human endeavors, from science to spirituality. Wise, who has taught healing arts and been involved with consciousness research for over twenty years, offers a lucid and unusual discussion of the multdimensional nature of reality that will intrigue even skeptical readers. An original, beautifully written work that definitely stretches the limits of accepted knowledge about the role of human consciousness in the universe." </p><p>M.F. SCHLITZ, Doctor of Science, University of Zurich Fellowship of Scientists, says: "LETTER TO EARTH establishes viable foundations for a science of consciousness. The theories it presents substantiate and unify the work generations of intuitive thinkers and writers. This is seminal thinking that can liberate us in understanding the Universe." </p><p>WILLIS HARMAN, Professor Emeritus, Stanford University, President Emeritus, Institute of Noetic Scientists, says: "Some of this we have heard before; the rest could change the world. If hard scientists will read it and extrapolate, they will see a new world." </p><p>PAUL GONZALES, UNITED BROADCASTING NETWORK, says: "...insights of classical magnitude. LETTER TO EARTH belongs on your bookshelf next to Plato and Aristotle." </p><p>MATTHEW FOX, author, THE REINVENTION OF WORK THE PHYSICS OF ANGELS, says: "Beautiful and serene, lucid and wise, this book challenges us to get a life -an inner life. One wonders if its origin is indeed from another sphere, one that could be called angelic." </p><p>TONY TRUPIANO, 75 syndicated radio stations, says: "Astounding! This book is astounding. LETTER TO EARTH offers us insights that could change the foundations of modern thinking." </p><p>DOROTHY and BURL IVES, Ambassadors of Goodwill, Burl Ives, Venerable balladeer, say: "We grew up with this book and the author. It is a rare opportunity to be offered a clear and intimate understanding of the Universe. Accept the offering. It will expand your mind and light a fire in your heart." </p><p>THE NAPRA REVIEW, says: "Wise writes lovingly and oh, so tenderly... Worth reading? Definitely. ...you are bound to get a lot of insight from these appealing reassuring and earnest expressions of love and light." </p><p>INDEPENDENT PUBLISHER, says: "For those lamenting that there is nothing 'new' in the New Age, a recent release might just change that opinion. LETTER TO EARTH is bound together in a stunning package, though it is the content that is capturing the attention of reviewers. Even the traditionally skeptical mainstream press has given the book star treatment." </p><p>LEADING EDGE REVIEW, says: "Bravo! LETTER TO EARTH is sure to start a spirited public dialogue." </p><p>NEXUS MAGAZINE, says: "Humanity is on the brink of an Age of Inspired Realism in which we will be able to integrate knowledge of the mulitdimensional nature of things into a coherent whole, inclusive of both science and spirituality. But our transformation to this state depends on the love we bring to bear, writes Elea Wise, in her beautifully produced compendium of wisdom, LETTER TO EARTH. " </p><p>NEW AGE RETAILER, says: "Elia Wise has undertaken a tremendous project -explaining the workings of the universe- and accomplished this task with inspired grace.... Her ideas are presented in concise and straightforward style, the style of a teacher or master speaking to an eager student...." </p><p>ALAN M. Abromovitz, M.D., says: "LETTER TO EARTH is a brilliantly conceived and elegantly expressed view of humanity as it is, and how it can be upon awakening the inner goodness of all being.

"A definite plus for any historical fiction collection." - VOYA<br><br>When her mother died, she told 14-year-old Walking Breeze to seek out her family-the Chelmsfords of Salem. She will find solace there.<br> But Ebie Chelmsford has other ideas. Ebie knows that her half-Shawnee "cousin" will take her place as grandfather's favorite. And Ebie will do anything to stop that--even trying to prove that the girl is an imposter...<br> Ebie thinks Walking Breeze is destroying the home Aunt Hannah has fought to keep together. But it's Ebie's actions, ultimately, that risk tearing apart the Chelmsford family, like the tattered threads of the family quilt.</p><p>Grade 6 Up?Set in Massachusetts in the turbulent days prior to the War of 1812, this sequel to A Stitch in Time (Scholastic, 1994) revolves around Walking Breeze, the half-Shawnee daughter of Thankful Chelmsford. When her mother dies, the 14-year-old girl finds a home with her relations in Salem, a starchy New England community that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the Shawnee village in which she grew up. Walking Breeze and the Chelmsfords not only deal with a clash of cultures, but also with Cousin Ebie's accusation that the newcomer is not Thankful's daughter. After many interruptions for Indian uprisings, battles on the high seas, and sundry domestic crises, she is vindicated. The characterization of Walking Breeze is credible in so far as it depicts the struggle of a Native American caught between two worlds; however, her dialogue is less than convincing, alternating between standard English and Tonto-like utterances. The portrait of Ebie as an insecure and jealous teen rings true. Although the plot is too busy for much depth, it will appeal to readers who prefer action to reflection. Rinaldi provides an accurate historical backdrop as she did in A Break with Charity (Harcourt, 1992), but this story lacks the substance and intensity of that fine novel.?Pat Katka, San Diego Public Library<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Laura Secord Canadian Cook Book (Classic Canadian Cookbook)</h2><p><p> Canadian cuisine is recognized the world over as combining a unique array of fresh ingredients and a variety of cultural influences tempered by tradition.

It has not always been an easy path. Ann struggled with and triumphed over a childhood stutter, body image, and alcoholism; Nancy suffered the pain and disappointment of fertility issues and a failed marriage but ultimately found love again and happiness as a mom. Through it all, the sisters drew from the strength of a family bond that trumps everything else, as told in this intimate, honest, and uniquely female take on the rock and roll life.</p><p>Throughout their career, Ann and Nancy have never found an answer to the question they are most frequently asked: "What is it like to be a woman in rock and roll?" <em>Kicking and Dreaming </em>puts that question to bed, once and for all.</p><p>Ann &amp; Nancy Wilson are the leaders of the rock band Heart, whose albums have sold thirty-five million records worldwide.

His career as a filmmaker spanned some fifty-seven years and yielded thirty-seven feature films. He made most of his movies abroad, spent much of his life in Ireland and Mexico, and remains one of the most intelligent and influential filmmakers in history. With equal attention given to Huston&#x2019;s impressive artistic output and tempestuous personal relationships, biographer Jeffrey Meyers presents a vivid narrative of Huston&#x2019;s remarkably rich creative life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The son of the famous stage and screen actor Walter Huston, John Huston was born in Nevada City, Missouri, and suffered from a weak heart that forced him to live as an invalid for much of his childhood. One day, however, he impulsively left his sickbed, dove over a waterfall, swam into a raging river and began to lead a strenuous life. He became an expert sportsman as well as a boxer, bullfighter, hunter, soldier, gambler and adventurer. Though he didn&#x2019;t finish high school, he was a man of true genius: a serious painter and amusing raconteur, playwright and story writer, stage and screen actor, director of plays on Broadway and operas at La Scala, autobiographer and political activist who crusaded against Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x2019;s anticommunist witch hunts in Hollywood. He was a discerning collector of art and connoisseur of literature, food and wine. Passionate about horses and women, he had five successively younger wives.&nbsp; <br><br>Meyers chronicles Huston&#x2019;s extraordinarily peripatetic life and examines his rise as a great masculine artist in the formidable tradition of Melville, Conrad and Hemingway, whose persona, ethos, prose style and virile code had a powerful influence on his life and work. Thirty-four of Huston&#x2019;s thirty-seven films adapted important novels, stories and plays, and Meyers perceptively describes how Huston brilliantly transformed the written word into the cinematic image. Huston&#x2019;s dominant theme is the almost impossible quest, tempered by detachment and irony. His heroes sacrifice honor in pursuit of wealth but fail in that venture, are mocked by cruel fate and remain defiant in the face of defeat. Based on research in Huston&#x2019;s personal and professional archives, and interviews with his children, friends and colleagues, this is the dramatic story of a courageous artist who, Meyers persuasively argues, is &#x201c;one of the most fascinating men who ever lived.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Jeffrey Meyers</b>, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, has recently been given an Award in Literature by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Thirty of his books have been translated into fourteen languages and seven alphabets, and published on six continents. He lives in Berkeley, California.ONE<br><br>Braving the Waterfall,<br><br>1906-1923<br><br>John Huston's earliest memory went back to his infancy in Weatherford, Texas, just west of Fort Worth. He vividly recalled riding at night with his mother, an expert equestrian who had once crossed the Mississippi on horseback. He sat in front of her in the saddle and was mesmerized by the sound of the horse's hooves striking the rough cobblestones. This primal memory-distant, nocturnal, tactile and auditory, riding through the streets in town-had a dreamlike quality. As the horse gently rocked them, his mother held him tight and bound him firmly to her.<br><br>Horses would play a vital part in Huston's life. As a young man, he spent a year in the Mexican cavalry and in later life went fox- hunting in Ireland; he owned racehorses and bet heavily on and off the track. He had friendships, love affairs and marriages with those who shared his passion. Horses also played an important role in many of his films: from the wounded gangster seeking refuge on his Kentucky horse farm at the end of The Asphalt Jungle to the terrified heroine being trampled to death by a horse at the end of Under the Volcano. He particularly liked Gulliver's Travels because Swift gave the horses the power of speech and made them far superior to the humans.<br><br>His young parents first met in a romantic theatrical setting during the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. His twenty-three-year old mother, Rhea, was a local reporter. His father, Walter, three years younger, had a small part with a touring company in a popular historical tragedy, The Sign of the Cross, where Christian martyrs were thrown to the lions. She recalled that "I watched the show and when I went backstage to interview the star, I ran into this handsome young man._._._._We went to an ice cream parlor. I told him I wanted to write plays and he was very encouraging. After that, while the show was in town, we saw each other almost every day. We went to the World's Fair, we roller-skated, bicycled, visited penny arcades, and had our fortunes told." One was a writer, the other an actor, and both parents had creative lives connected to performance. Even during their courtship, they were always on the move.<br><br>Rhea's grandfather, Colonel William Pitt Richardson, had had a distinguished career. He attended Washington College in Pennsylvania, fought against Mexico in the war of 1846-48 and became a lawyer. On May 2, 1863, when the Union forces were defeated at Chancellorsville, Virginia, Richardson was severely wounded in the shoulder and lost the use of his right arm. In 1864 he became attorney general of Ohio and later that year was brevetted brigadier general. Ten days before he was wounded, the men of the 25th Regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry presented their colonel with a silver-sheathed sword. Huston inherited this sword and proudly used it in his Civil War film, The Red Badge of Courage.<br><br>Huston was named after his maternal grandfather, John Marcellus Gore, himself named after a Roman military commander in the Gallic War. Gore "was a genius at riding the crest of a wave and a raise-the-pot gambler._._._._Extravagance was typical of him. When things were going his way, the sky was the limit-and even when they were going against him, the best was none too good." Huston resembled him in his wild gambling, reckless spending and love of luxury.<br><br>Rhea (pronounced REE-ah) was named for the mother of Zeus. She was born in New Castle, Indiana, about forty miles east of Indianapolis, in 1881. An only child, adored by her father, she was only five feet four inches tall, but was ambitious, critical, willful and domineering. A youthful photo shows her, slightly horse-faced, in a cloche hat, a long string of pearls and a velvet dress. John Weld, Walter's friend and future biographer, later met her in Paris and found her "rather plain-looking, nobody of any charm or attractiveness. She wasn't pretty and she wasn't dressed particularly smartly, but she was very talkative." Like the American novelist Theodore Dreiser, born in Indiana ten years before, Rhea became a roving reporter. Whether unable or unwilling to hold a steady job, or restless and eager to advance by moving around in the profession, she worked on the St. Louis Star, Cincinnati Enquirer, Niagara Falls Gazette and Minneapolis Tribune. A rather masculine woman by the standards of the time, dowdy and opinionated, fiercely independent and aggressive, she smoked and rode horses, had a career and competed against men in their profession. Huston later recalled that his mother sometimes played the helpless female. Rhea could burst into tears whenever she wished and her reason for crying was as false as her tears. Pausing for emphasis, he described her as "nervous_._._._very active_._._._smoked. When I say nervous, I mean tending toward the neurotic. She was better with animals than with people. She liked excitement. Still, I was closer to her than to my father."1 Like Rhea, John was energetic, a heavy smoker, thrived on excitement and knew how to handle animals.<br><br>John's father, Walter Huston, was born in Toronto in 1884. Walter's mother was Scottish, his father an Irish carpenter. The youngest of four children, the restless Walter attended five different schools. But he left school early, against the wishes of his father, who warned him that he'd have to start working immediately. The writer James Agee noted that John inherited Walter's height and good looks: "John is a leathery, ski-nosed man, with hard, arresting eyes, who suggests a hammered-out version of his father." Like Walter, John was incorrigibly restless and wandering, refusing to settle down to anything that resembled a stable existence. Walter's parents thought their twenty-year-old son was too young to marry and disliked Rhea, who seemed to be trying to trap him. But the Hustons' disapproval made no difference. Despite their brief acquaintance, the couple married in St. Louis-secretly and privately-on December 31, 1904. After their wedding, Walter returned to acting, and they set off with a theatrical road company that went as far west as Arizona.<br><br>�__II �<br><br>By the summer of 1906 Rhea and Walter had run out of money and were living near her parents. John Marcellus Huston was born on August 5, 1906, in their brick house at 404 S. Adams in Nevada, Missouri-in the same year as the film directors Billy Wilder and Otto Preminger. The town, with a population of 7,400, was located about a hundred miles from Kansas City, in the southwest corner of the state. It was named by a county clerk who'd visited Nevada City, California, after the Gold Rush of 1848. A local historian noted that "agriculture was the major business, though the railroads were big for a time. Also in 1906 there were two huge employers: a lead-zinc smelting industry (two or three firms) with five hundred employees; and the State Hospital for the Insane (originally the Lunatic Asylum)." Assuming a huckster's tone in a rapturous but ironic letter, the Missouri-born Mark Twain portrayed the state as a place of fair promises and false hopes: "Come right along to Missouri! Don't wait and worry about a good price but sell out for whatever you can get, and come along, or you might be too late._._._._It's the grandest country-the loveliest land-the purest atmosphere._._._._I've got the biggest scheme on earth._._._._Mum's the word-don't whisper-keep it to yourself."<br><br>Huston's grandfather John Gore, like Twain's father, had run out of luck and come to grief after being lured to Missouri. Ever optimistic, he had "purchased the public utilities after they had been thrown into the hands of the receiver by the St. Louis Trust Company._._._._He started to build a new power house in the railway yards directly east of Union Station and had much machinery purchased and delivered, but was financially unable to complete his plans and later sold out."2 Gore placed these valuable properties in the unreliable hands of his son-in-law Walter, who had some slight training as an engineer.<br><br>According to one version of the story, soon after John's birth a fire broke out that tested Walter's grasp of the valves and gauges that adjusted the water pressure. As the far end of town blazed out of control, the fire chief kept screaming for more water pressure. Walter warned him of the danger, but followed the frantic orders and kept raising the pressure until the pistons of the pump exploded with a horrific bang. The water main burst, the street was flooded and the raging fire destroyed a considerable part of the town. The town council wisely refused to extend Gore's franchise and he was driven into bankruptcy. John, heightening the story of his father's epic incompetence and hasty departure, later transformed it into one of his star turns. In An Open Book he wrote that his parents "were living in Nevada, Missouri, because John Gore had won the light-power- and-water company of that town in a poker game. When Mother and Dad arrived, Grandpa made Dad the chief engineer of the company._._._._When a fire broke out in town, the fire chief called for more water pressure and Dad gave it to him. Apparently he shouldn't have, or perhaps he turned the wrong valve, because the water main broke. The entire town on one side of the tracks burned down. We left precipitously in the middle of the night by buckboard- and headed for the state line." These biblical portents seemed to mark the birth of an extraordinary child, but this amusing, oft- repeated story was not true. In a 1950 telegram to Life magazine, which was running an article on Huston, the editor of the local newspaper reported the actual facts: "Local files show two fires in year after Huston was born. Water pressure good at both conflagrations. No record of ruined machinery at water plant. Town didn't burn down. No record of Hustons fleeing community."<br><br>The family left Missouri, and Gore, supreme manipulator and con artist, managed to acquire the electric light and power plant in Weatherford, Texas. He once again hired good old Walter to run them. Realizing that he was out of his depth, the impulsive, sometimes irresponsible Walter told Rhea that he wanted to return to the theater. During one of their frequent arguments Walter, aware that itinerant acting and family life were incompatible, exclaimed that "he would have left long ago had it not been for the baby." She angrily replied: "Don't detain yourself on his account!" Realizing that they were hopelessly mismatched, she packed her things, took all their money and left him forever. They parted company in 1909, when John was three years old, and divorced three years later. Emphasizing her youthful innocence, though she was actually twenty-three at the time of her marriage, Rhea later described her feelings in an unpublished memoir. She had a "blind passionate eagerness that swept her off her feet when she met and married Walter, before her hair was up and her skirts down. She had just walked out on Wally because eventually her whole nature revolted at his petty cowardices."3 She felt he was inhibited, weak and feckless, and was furious at his refusal to settle down and take responsibility for his family.<br><br>Walter drifted out of his son's life, and they would not be reunited until John moved to New York in 1924. After joining a stock company in Topeka, Kansas, Walter formed a vaudeville team with an oddly named woman, Bayonne Whipple, which lasted from 1910 until 1923. They led a precarious wandering life, often broke and hungry, sitting up all night in rocking trains between brief stops in cheap boardinghouses, dreary hotels and run-down theaters on the muddy streets of provincial towns. Bayonne, seven years older than Walter, married him in 1915; they separated in 1924 and divorced in 1931. John, who had no regrets about his father's divorce from Rhea, wondered why Walter had ever married Bayonne: "I remember thinking: My God, how could my father bear to have this tagging along? She was just dull, narrow. A vaudevillian trying to be a lady. She was full of pretenses. But I must say, the Hustons were extraordinary with her. They treated her as though she was possible. And she wasn't."<br><br>After many years of struggle, Walter's stage career finally took off in 1924 when he left Bayonne and appeared as Ephraim Cabot in Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms. Ten years later he acted in the stage version of Sinclair Lewis' Dodsworth, and he became friends with O'Neill and Lewis, both Nobel Prize winners. Walter went to Hollywood in 1929, soon after talkies began. He made his first film at the age of forty-five, and then played the villain, opposite Gary Cooper, in The Virginian (1929). His effective, understated acting got him plenty of work; his other notable appearances included the title role in Abraham Lincoln (1930) and the sex-obsessed missionary in Somerset Maugham's Rain (1932). He worked both in Hollywood and on Broadway and often returned to the stage. He enjoyed a memorable success when he sang the poignant "September Song" in Maxwell Anderson's Knickerbocker Holiday (1938), and his performance became a classic recording.<br><br>Walter's eventual success as an actor would later give John enormous benefits, but his parents' separation and financial struggles made for a difficult childhood. He recalled his own precocious stage debut at the age of three, when the family had moved to Texas, in George M. Cohan's patriotic play Little Johnny Jones (1904). In a photograph he wears a red, white and blue satin Uncle Sam costume, with wide- striped trousers, cutaway jacket speckled with four large stars, high stiff collar and black string tie. He looks like an angry midget, with wild curly hair, a scowling expression and his right hand raised in a defiant gesture.<br><br>John never experienced a normal family life and had no stability as a child. As Rhea tried to support herself and her son, they wandered-in a curious parallel to Walter's life-from Missouri and Texas to Indiana (where her sister lived), St. Paul, Los Angeles and Phoenix. "When I was a kid I never had a home," John said. "I was always on the [move], living out of dressing rooms and hotels." Though it was difficult to attend new schools and make new friends, he found the constant movement adventurous and exciting: "I never tired of traveling from town to town with Mother. I've always loved trains. I remember so well the smell, look, taste of soot, the sounds of passing over trestles and bridges, walking through the cars, feet braced and struggling for balance"-as in a boxing match. "There was the thrill of sleeping in upper berths and the splendor of the dining cars." Later on, when John tried to put down roots in Ireland and Mexico, he continued to travel for most of the year while making movies all over the world.<br><br>A third early memory completed the suite that would dominate John's life: horses, acting and sex. He remembered lying in bed with the nursemaid who'd been hired to take care of him: "Her skirt was up and her behind was bare. I patted it and stroked it and laid my cheek against it."4 He looked forward to further explorations, cheek to cheek, but was keenly disappointed when his mother, suspecting the worst, fired the seductive nursemaid.<br><br>Though spoiled, John also felt stifled by the oppressively close connection to his neurotic mother. Rhea, who'd lost her first baby in a miscarriage and had left her husband, clung to her sickly only child.</p><h2>Girl in Dior (Biographies)</h2><p><b>Winner of:</b><br>YALSA 2016 Great Graphic Novels for Teens<br><br>In February of 1947, the&nbsp;<i>cr�me de la cr�me</i>&nbsp;of&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;haute couture have flocked to see Christian Dior&#x2019;s debut fashion show.

On these pages, <i>Time</i> magazine correspondent Douglas C. Waller--granted surprising levels of access by the Pentagon--describes life onboard the USS <i>Nebraska</i>, a Trident nuclear submarine, in compelling detail. <i>Big Red</i> lacks the thrills of <i>Blind Man's Bluff</i>, but it is nonetheless an engrossing book on the routines of the silent service. <p> The <i>Nebraska</i> is an awesome triumph of military engineering: standing on end, it would be taller than the Washington Monument. And its might is impressive, including missiles that could wipe out Moscow and torpedoes "with three times the explosive power of the 1995 blast that leveled the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City." Readers will gain an intimate understanding of how the Trident works without ever having to set foot on one themselves. Waller has an uncanny sense of what questions to probe, such as why Trident submariners aren't likely to drown in claustrophobic compartments--a staple scene in submarine movies. (Answer: Flooding would cause the sub to sink, and then crushing water pressure would end the ordeal before the air ran out.) And yet movies are more than diversions, writes Waller: "Practically every Trident submariner had seen <i>Crimson Tide</i> and been jarred by it.... Officers still discuss <i>Crimson Tide</i> during private seminars on commanding a ship." </p><p> Waller also displays a powerful sense of irony. He describes a Sunday service onboard the <i>Nebraska</i>, and then deadpans, "Their worship over, [the submariners] would now practice how to destroy much of what God created." He also isn't afraid to ask difficult questions, such as whether women and gays should be allowed onboard (currently, neither are), or to note that marital fidelity is a problem for both husbands at port call and the wives they leave back home. It would be wrong to say <i>Big Red</i> reads like a potboiler--there are no <i>Crimson Tide</i>-like moments of near launches or mutiny--but it is exciting in its own way. This is at once an impressive journalistic achievement and an incredibly informative book. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p><p>Douglas C. Waller is a correspondent for the <i>Time</i> magazine.

He knows what tonight will bring: the torment of another night of insomnia.Each night has become agonizingly familiar. Exhausted, Alan gets into bed and turns out the lights to go to sleep, only to lie wide awake. The harder he tries to fall asleep, the more he tosses and turns and the more tense and frustrated he feels. With the realization that he can't fall asleep comes a distressing wave of anxiety and stressful thoughts about sleep--"I've got to get some sleep or I'll never function tomorrow!"--and the worries about the problems in his life: tomorrow's meeting, Friday's deadline, his company's downsizing, his mother's illness. All are made worse by the loneliness and darkness of the night.Even when Alan finally falls asleep he cannot escape insomnia. After just a few hours, he wakes up and tosses and turns before falling back to sleep just as the sun rises.When the alarm clock rings, Alan has to drag himself out of bed, angry and depressed in the knowledge that yet another day feeling wiped out, helpless, and desperate awaits him.Insomnia has become Alan's living nightmare.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Does Alan's ordeal sound familiar? It does for most insomniacs, who live in an interminable state of anxiety concerning insomnia and its effects on their lives. Like Alan, they also feel hopeless, powerless, and trapped by their lack of control over sleep, and they dread what, for most people, is an enjoyable experience--going to bed.And no wonder. The anger, exhaustion, and irritability caused by insomnia can handicap mood, productivity, coping skills, and family and social life, and deprive insomniacs of a sense of joy and well-being. They grow even more frustrated or depressed by family or friends who tell them "it's all in your head" or "just relax," and may start to wonder whether they have a "psychological" problem. As a consequence, insomniacs feel embarrassed or even ashamed about their condition, which diminishes their self-esteem.Doctors and Sleeping PillsIt is stressful enough to endure insomnia, but many doctors' reactions to it can make it even worse. They frequently don't ask about insomnia, overlook it, or simply ignore it. Why? Because insomnia is so ubiquitous that it is often dismissed by doctors as an unavoidable and normal part of life!Doctors are not trained to diagnose or treat insomnia. Even though it is one of the most frequent health complaints today, doctors receive less than one hour of training on sleep problems during their entire medical education. This lack of training is compounded by the fact that, until recently, little federal funding has been allocated for insomnia research, which means that information about treating insomnia is not available to doctors in medical and scientific journals. (Fortunately, Congress and the National Institutes of Health have started to appropriate more money for sleep and insomnia research, as evidenced by the decision to fund my own research for four years.)It is easy to understand why doctors are not comfortable treating insomnia. And when they are not comfortable treating something, they are inclined to avoid it. As Dr. William Dement, an internationalexpert on sleep disorders and director of the Sleep Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine, explains, "Most physicians dread the arrival of a chronic insomnia patient. If one asks a large group of doctors if any of them enjoy managing chronic insomnia, not a single hand will go up." It is no wonder that the vast majority of cases of insomnia go undiagnosed and untreated!There is another reason insomniacs can't turn to their doctor for help: medicine has not developed an effective treatment for insomnia. Until recently, the only medical treatments available were sleeping pills such as Halcion, Restoril, Dalmane, Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and many others. Sleeping pills, however, are no longer considered a safe or appropriate treatment for chronic insomnia because they can have serious side effects that far outweigh their benefits; are only moderately effective for insomnia and stop working over time; strengthen the belief that the cure for insomnia comes from external factors; and can lead to physical or psychological dependency, which can cause feelings of helplessness, loss of control, and lowered self-esteem.Most important, <i>sleeping pills don't cure insomnia, because they don't treat the causes of insomnia.</i> Consequently, if you rely on sleeping pills, your sleep may improve while you take the pills, but as soon as you stop, your insomnia will return, thereby sustaining the cycle of insomnia and sleeping pills.Given everything we know about the drawbacks to sleeping pills, why do so many doctors still prescribe them? Partly because when doctors are busy and don't know what to do about insomnia, sleeping pills are a fast and easy solution. Another reason is the pervasive influence of drug companies, which sponsor scientific conferences, advertise in medical journals, send sales personnel to doctors' offices, supply free samples of sleep medications, and fund research studies that pay part of doctors' salaries. Therefore, doctors may be subtly influenced to prescribe the sleeping pills that the drug companies manufacture.Doctors also prescribe sleeping pills because of the predominant attitude in medicine today that drugs are the best treatment for health problems. This drug-oriented approach, which focuses on treating the body, has worked well for acute and infectious illnesses.However, it has been largely ineffective in the treatment of today's chronic health problems such as stroke, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, insomnia, chronic pain, and mental illness, in which emotional, behavioral, and lifestyle factors play a prominent role.Psychotherapy and Over-the-Counter Sleep AidsNot surprisingly, 85 percent of insomniacs never seek medical help. Insomnia has become an epidemic affecting desperate, silent sufferers who, believing that their doctors can't help them or will prescribe habit-forming prescription sleeping pills, have been left to fend for themselves, typically spending years battling the problem futilely and suffering needlessly.You may be one of the many insomniacs who have turned to expensive, time-consuming psychotherapy in your belief, or perhaps your doctor's, that insomnia is caused by "psychological problems." Not only does this belief induce feelings of helplessness and diminished self-esteem; there also is no scientific proof that psychotherapy is effective for insomnia, in large part because the majority of insomniacs do not have a psychiatric problem such as anxiety or depression. This is why trying to treat insomnia as a problem caused by psychiatric factors is destined to fail and only contributes to the stigma of insomnia being a "psychiatric" problem.Millions of other insomniacs have turned to a slew of new over-the-counter nighttime sleep aids such as Tylenol PM, Excedrin PM, and Anacin PM, whose manufacturers have capitalized on this epidemic. These products, cloaked in the brand names of trusted medicines, avoid the stigma associated with prescription sleeping pills. Consequently, they are one of the fastest-growing classes of health care products today, with sales soaring to over $100 million in 1992. Yet, in truth, there is no scientific evidence that these medications are any more effective than a sugar pill!Like prescription sleeping pills, over-the-counter sleeping aids can have unwanted side effects, lose effectiveness over time, and bolsterthe belief that the cure for insomnia comes from something external, which can foster psychological dependency and feelings of helplessness. Most important, these sleep aids don't cure insomnia because they don't treat the causes. Therefore, if you stop taking over-the-counter sleep aids, your insomnia will return.Insomniacs spent an additional $200 million annually on one recent self-help craze for insomnia: melatonin. Health fads are nothing new, but rarely does one strike with the force of "melatonin madness," which hit its peak in 1995. Advertised at drugstores with signs proclaiming WE HAVE MELATONIN and extolled by the media and national magazines and books as the cure-all for insomnia, melatonin has also been trumpeted as a cure for heart disease, diabetes, depression, and aging. Demand for melatonin was so high that for almost a year vendors had a hard time keeping it in stock.As we will see, however, the exaggerated claims about melatonin's benefits for insomniacs go far beyond established scientific evidence. It turns out that these claims are based on only a few selected studies, one of which was conducted by a scientist who owns a company that sells melatonin. What insomniacs do not know is that there are just as many studies showing that melatonin has no consistent beneficial effect on insomnia. Consequently, the public has been given an unbalanced picture about the present state of knowledge concerning melatonin, knowledge that is woefully incomplete. Therefore, if you are using melatonin, you are assuming unknown risks.Why are insomniacs willing to spend money on melatonin and gamble their health on unproven claims about its effects on sleep? Probably because melatonin is available over the counter, is inexpensive, is promoted as "natural" (lead is also natural, yet can be dangerous), and because the lure of a fast and easy panacea for insomnia is irresistible.Although melatonin may ultimately prove to be effective for some insomniacs, you are risking your health by using it. You are also relying on something external, which only leads to dependency. And because melatonin, like all drugs, does not treat the causes of insomnia, your insomnia will return if you stop taking it.A Breakthrough in the Treatment of InsomniaThe only true hope for insomnia sufferers is the development of a safe, natural, and effective drug-free treatment that addresses the causes of insomnia. This program has not existed--until now.Based on ten years of research and clinical practice that I have conducted at Harvard Medical School, the groundbreaking program presented in this book is the <i>only</i> drug-free program scientifically proven to conquer insomnia. The results are extraordinary: 100 percent of insomnia patients report improved sleep and 75 percent become normal sleepers as a result of this program; improved sleep is seen to be maintained or even enhanced at long-term follow-up; and insomniacs fall asleep faster using this program than using sleeping pills.The program is also natural, easy to learn, and practical. It has no side effects, yields results that last, optimizes empowerment and self-control by demonstrating that the cure for insomnia resides within you, enhances mind-body control, and improves health and well-being.Why This Program Is DifferentMy insomnia program achieves its remarkable results because it is based on a simple yet powerful concept: <i>insomnia can only be treated by addressing all the underlying causes.</i> In most instances, the causes of insomnia are thoughts and behaviors (habits) that are learned and can be unlearned. Some examples include:� Attitudes and beliefs about sleep� Negative, stressful thoughts about insomnia� Feelings of loss of control over sleep� Inadequate exercise or exposure to sunlight� Going to bed too early or sleeping too late� Trying to control sleep rather than letting it occur naturally� Negative responses to stress� Lying awake in bed, frustrated and tenseThe following story, about one of my patients, illustrates the idea that insomnia is caused by thoughts and behaviors. Does her experience sound familiar?&nbsp;<br>Carol was a forty-seven-year-old nurse whose insomnia began after the death of a close friend. After experiencing sleeplessness for a few weeks, she started to worry about it, which only made it harder for her to sleep. Carol also began "trying" to fall asleep, which backfired and made her more wide awake, tense, and frustrated.After a month of sleepless nights, Carol began to expect that she wouldn't sleep, which caused her to fear going to bed. Although Carol had exercised for years, she became so fatigued from insomnia that she stopped exercising. She also began to try to catch up on sleep by spending more time in bed and sleeping late on weekends, all of which seemed to make her sleep worse.Carol became so desperate that she began drinking a glass of wine or taking a sleeping pill to fall sleep, both of which disturbed the quality of her sleep and made her feel guilty and out of control. Her preoccupation with sleep, coupled with the stress of diminished performance at work, only compounded her insomnia. It wasn't long before Carol began to wonder if something was wrong with her mind and whether she should visit a psychiatrist.By the time Carol came to see me, she was sleeping less than five hours per night and had been experiencing insomnia for several years. As a result, she always felt exhausted and irritable and was becoming depressed. She perceived her bed as the "enemy" and wondered whether she would ever sleep well again.Carol then entered my Insomnia Program at Deaconess Hospital. After just a few days in the program, her sleep started to improve. After six weeks, she eliminated sleeping pills, fell asleep easily, and stayed asleep. As a result, she was able to sleep over eight hours per night, awakened refreshed, and "loved her bed again." She also felt more empowered, more confident, and had more control over her mind and body. Even Carol's husband remarked that she was like a new person!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Larry was another patient who came to my program suffering from insomnia. He was a fifty-year-old attorney whose insomnia began during law school. Although Larry could fall asleep easily, he frequently awoke during the night and would lie awake for hours. When Larry came to see me, he had been experiencing insomnia for more than five years and was sleeping about four hours per night, leaving him feeling wiped out, frustrated, and desperate.After two weeks in my program, Larry slept through the night for the first time in years. By the time he completed the program, he was sleeping nearly seven hours per night and was able to fall asleep again easily if he woke up. Larry was calmer, more energetic, and more productive during the day and also felt more control over his emotions and health.&nbsp;<br>Carol and Larry achieved their remarkable success by learning a variety of nondrug techniques:� Viewing insomnia as a learned problem that can be unlearned� Changing negative, stressful thoughts about sleep� Managing stress more effectively� Eliciting the relaxation response, an inborn biological response that allowed them to voluntarily produce the brain-wave patterns that induce sleep� Using the power and biology of positive beliefs about sleep� Strengthening the brain's sleep rhythm by reducing excessive time in bed and getting out of bed at the same time every day� Receiving exposure to bright sunlight and exercising at specific times of the day</p><h2>Robert Asprin&#39;s Myth Adventures</h2><p>Start at the beginning, in Another Fine Myth, as Skeeve, an apprentice wizard, meets the demon Aahz.

After stepping into a mysterious beam of light, Mark is transported to another place--a strange and hostile world. As Mark tries to find his way back home, he learns to survive in this dangerous jungle, calling on reserves of strength he didn't know he had. Encountering wild creatures, primitive tribes, and a more advanced and warlike group of humans, the young protagonist is forced to grow up before he can return to the life he once knew.

Crime novelists seem to have no qualms about sacrificing the people nearest and dearest to their protagonists, if doing so will advance plot development or bestow emotional depth upon their series stars. Peter Robinson continues this ruthless tradition in <i>Strange Affair</i>, his tension-packed 15th novel featuring headstrong British Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks. Still on the mend after the blazing finale of 2004's <i>Playing with Fire</i>, temporarily sworn off whiskey but back to smoking, Banks is interrupted in the midst of brooding over his life and failed relationships by a message from his estranged younger brother, Roy, who says he needs the DCI's help in "a matter of life and death." Concerned, especially since Roy boasts a history of dubious business dealings, Banks leaves Yorkshire for his sibling's home in London, only to find that residence unlocked, Roy's computer missing, and his cell phone left behind. After learning that Roy was last seen stepping into a car with an unidentified man, and receiving on Roy's mobile what appears to be a photo of his only brother slumped over in a chair, the cop fears that a kidnapping has occurred.<p> Meanwhile, back in Eastvale, Banks's colleague and ex-lover, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, probes the shooting death of Jennifer Clewes, a 27-year-old family planning center administrator from London who's been found in her car, with the address of Banks's once-ruined (and recently broken into) cottage tucked into her jeans pocket. As Annie seeks to identify Clewes's attacker and determine whether this crime fits a pattern of roadway assaults, she's anxious also to discover what connection Banks may have to the case. But the DCI is frustratingly nowhere to be found.</p><p> Like 2003's <i>Close to Home</i>, <i>Strange Affair</i> adds some welcome bricks to Banks's back story, this time forcing him to reappraise a brother whom he had long resented and distrusted. Simultaneously, Robinson's latest police procedural delivers artfully contrived, intersecting story lines charged with rumors of international arms dealing, hints of misdeeds at a women's clinic, secondary players so shady they might be invisible after sundown, and insights into just how far Banks's career has distanced him from folks less steeped in the ugly side of mankind. An immensely satisfying mystery, filled with professional risks and personal regrets, this is truly an <i>Affair</i> to remember. --<i>J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><p>On a warm summer night, an attractive woman hurtles north in a blue Peugeot with a hastily scrawled address in her pocket, while, back in London, a desperate man leaves an urgent late-night phone message on his brother's answering machine. By sunrise the next morning, the woman is found inside her car along an otherwise peaceful country lane, shot, execution-style, through the head.</p><p>Welcome to the idyllic Yorkshire Dales, where Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot arrives on the scene and discovers, to her surprise, a slip of paper in the dead woman's pocket that bears the name of her colleague and erstwhile lover, Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks. Banks, meanwhile -- already haunted and withdrawn after nearly dying in the fire that destroyed his home -- has gone missing just when he's needed most, and has left plenty of questions behind.</p><p>As Annie struggles to determine whether or not Banks is safe -- and what role he may have played in the woman's murder -- Banks himself investigates the mysterious disappearance of his estranged brother, Roy, whose late-night call for help brings Banks back to London. Working from Roy's swank apartment, Banks makes the rounds to Roy's old haunts and slowly inhabits the life of his younger brother -- the black sheep of the family, who always seemed to sail a little too close to the wind. As the trail of clues about Roy's life and associations draws Banks into a dark circle of conspiracy and corruption, mobsters and murder, Banks suddenly realizes he's running out of time to save Roy, and by digging too deep, he may be exposing himself and his family to the same -- possibly deadly -- danger.</p></p><h2>A Zoo in My Luggage</h2><p>This is the true and hilarious story of how Gerald Durrell and his wife set up their own zoo. Journeying to the Cameroons, he and his wife, helped by the renowned Fon of Bafut, managed to collect &#39;plenty beef.&#39; Their difficulties began when they found themselves back at home, with Cholmondely the chimpanzee, Bug-Eye the bush-baby, and other founder members...and nowhere to put them.</p><p>Gerald Durrell was born in 1925 at Jamshedpur, India. In 1928 his family returned to England and then went to live on the Continent. They settled on the island of Corfu, and during this time he made a special study of zoology and kept a large number of local wild animals as pets. In 1945 he joined the staff of Whipsnade Park as a student keeper and in 1947 he financed, organized and led his first animal-collecting expedition to the Cameroons. He undertook numerous further expeditions, visiting Paraguay, Argentina, Sierra Leone, Mexico, Mauritius, Assam and Madagascar. His first television programme, &#39;Two in the Bush&#39;, was made in 1962 when he and his first wife travelled to New Zealand, Australia and Malaya. He went on to make seventy programmes out of his trips around the world. In 1959 he founded the Jersey Zoological Park, of which he was Director, and in 1964 he founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. He was awarded the OBE in 1982.As a self-described &#39;champion of small uglies&#39;, Durrell dedicated his life to the preservation of wildlife, and it is through his efforts that creatures such as the Mauritius pink pigeon and the Rodrigues fruit bat have avoided extinction. Encouraged to write about his life&#39;s work by his novelist brother Lawrence, Durrell published his first book, The Overloaded Ark, in 1953. It soon became a bestseller and he went on to write thirty-six other titles, including My Family and Other Animals, The Bafut Beagles, Encounters with Animals, The Drunken Forest, A Zoo in My Luggage, The Whispering Land, Menagerie Manor, The Amateur Naturalist, The Aye-Aye and I and, with Lee Durrell, Durrell in Russia.Gerald Durrell died in 1995.

In their seventh outing, they're leaps and bounds ahead of Harry Haristeen, the spunky postmistress they call Mom. Long before anyone else knows what's going on, they've figured out the connection between the shot fired at wealthy Sir Henry Vane-Tempest during the reenactment of a Civil War battle and a missing airplane hidden in Tally Urquhart's barn. They're better at finding evidence trampled underfoot at a crime scene than any detective is, and they know just whose lap to drop it in. While they might not understand exactly why county commissioner Archie Ingram is so exercised about Vane-Tempest's plans for development in Albemarle County--particularly when it promises to make him as wealthy as the husband of the woman he loves--they've sniffed out the sexual shenanigans that threaten to derail the private pact between Crozet's leading citizens. If Harry and her friends knew what the animals know, there'd be no mystery about it; there'd only be a charming and lighthearted story of chicanery in the new Old South with plenty of local color, the scent of lilacs wafting through every page, and the deft prose of a writer on top of her game. But then, there'd be no raison d'etre for the liveliest scene in the book, wherein Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tee take a turbo-charged Porsche for a breakneck ride through Virginia's verdant hills and dales. By the end of the book, the only mystery is whether Harry and Fair, her favorite ex-husband, will manage to get back together again in the next installment--or the one after that--of this popular series. <i>--Jane Adams</i>"Charming....

Sure, it was spring. But these storms were over the top.<br> <br>In the end, Summer saved my life.<br> <br>I know. Sounds bizarre.<br> <br>This is what happened.<br> <br>Bloated, dark clouds hung low to the ground, but so far no rain.<br> <br>Lucky break. I&#x2019;d spent the morning digging up a corpse.<br> <br>Sound macabre? Just part of the job. I&#x2019;m a forensic anthropologist. I recover and analyze the dead that present in less than pristine condition&#x2014;the burned, mummified, mutilated, dismembered, decomposed, and skeletal.<br> <br>OK. Today&#x2019;s target wasn&#x2019;t actually a corpse. I&#x2019;d been searching for overlooked body parts.<br> <br>Short version. Last fall a housewife vanished from her Cabarrus County home in rural North Carolina. A week ago, while I was away on a working vacation in Hawaii, a trucker admitted to strangling the woman and burying her body in a sandpit. Impatient, the local cops had sallied forth with shovels and buckets. They delivered the bones in a Mott&#x2019;s applesauce carton to my employer, the Medical Examiner&#x2019;s Office, in neighboring Mecklenburg County.<br> <br>Yesterday, my aloha tan still glowing, I&#x2019;d begun my analysis. A skeletal inventory revealed that the hyoid, the mandible, and all of the upper incisors and canines were missing.<br> <br>No teeth, no dental ID. No hyoid, no evidence of strangulation. Dr. Tim Larabee, the Mecklenburg County medical examiner, asked me to have a second go at the sandpit.<br> <br>Correcting screwups usually makes me cranky. Today I was feeling upbeat.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d quickly found the missing bits and dispatched them to the MCME facility in Charlotte. I was en route to a shower, a late lunch, and time with my cat.<br> <br>It was 1:50 p.m. My sweat-soaked tee was pasted to my back. My hair was yanked into a ratty knot. Sand lined my scalp and undies. Nevertheless, I was humming. Al Yankovic, &#x201c;White &amp; Nerdy.&#x201d; What can I say? I&#x2019;d watched a YouTube video and the tune lodged in my head.<br> <br>Wind buffeted my Mazda as I merged onto southbound I-85. Slightly uneasy, I glanced at the sky, then thumbed on NPR.<br> <br>Terry Gross was finishing an interview with W. S. Merwin, the U.S. poet laureate. Both were indifferent to the conditions outside my car.<br> <br>Fair enough. The show was produced in Philadelphia, five hundred miles north of Dixie.<br> <br>Terry launched into a teaser about an upcoming guest. I never caught the name.<br> <br> <i>Beep! Beep! Beep!</i> <br> <br> <i>The National Weather Service has issued a severe-weather warning for parts of the North Carolina piedmont, including Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Anson, Stanly, and Union counties. Severe thunderstorms are expected to move through the area within the next hour. Rainfall of one to three inches is anticipated, creating the potential for flash flooding. Atmospheric conditions are favorable for the development of tornadoes. Stay tuned to this station for further updates.</i> <br> <br> <i>Beep! Beep! Beep!</i> <br> <br>I tightened my grip on the wheel and goosed my speed to seventy-five. Risky in a sixty-five-mile-an-hour zone, but I wanted to reach home before the deluge.<br> <br>Moments later Terry was interrupted again, this time by a muted <i>whoop-whoop</i>.<br> <br>My eyes flicked to the radio.<br> <br> <i>Whoop!</i> <br> <br>Feeling stupid, I checked the rearview mirror.<br> <br>A police cruiser was riding my bumper.<br> <br>Annoyed, I pulled to the shoulder and lowered my window. When the cop approached, I held out my license.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dr. Temperance Brennan?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Looking somewhat worse for wear.&#x201d; I beamed what I hoped was a winning smile.<br> <br>Johnny Law did not beam back. &#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be necessary,&#x201d; indicating my license.<br> <br>Puzzled, I looked up at the guy. He was mid-twenties, slim, with an infant mustache that appeared to be going nowhere. A badge on his chest said R. Warner.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Concord Police Department received a request from the Mecklenburg County medical examiner to intercept and divert you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Larabee sent the cops to find me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. When I arrived at the recovery site, you&#x2019;d left.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t he call me directly?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Apparently he couldn&#x2019;t get through.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course not. While digging, I&#x2019;d locked my iPhone in the car to protect it from sand.<br> <br>&#x201c;My phone is in the glove compartment.&#x201d; No need to alarm Officer Warner. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> <br>The numbers on the little screen indicated three missed calls from Larabee. Three messages. I listened to the first: &#x201c;Long story, which I&#x2019;ll share when you&#x2019;re back. The Concord PD received a report of a body at the Morehead Road landfill. Chapel Hill wants us to handle it. I&#x2019;m elbow-deep in an autopsy. Since you&#x2019;re in the area, I hoped you could swing by to check it out. Joe Hawkins is diverting that way with the van, just in case they&#x2019;ve actually got something for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>The second message was the same as the first. Ditto the third, but more terse. It ended with the inducement: You&#x2019;re a champ, Tempe.<br> <br>A landfill in a storm? The champ was suddenly not so chipper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, we should hurry. The rain won&#x2019;t hold off much longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lead on.&#x201d; I could not have said this with less enthusiasm.<br> <br>Warner returned to his cruiser, whoop-whooped, then pulled into traffic. Inwardly cursing Larabee, Warner, and the landfill, I palm-slapped the gearshift and followed.<br> <br>Traffic on I-85 was unusually heavy for Thursday, midafter-noon. As we approached Concord, I could see that the Bruton Smith Boulevard exit ramp was a parking lot.<br> <br>And realized what a nightmare this little detour of Larabee&#x2019;s would be.<br> <br>The Morehead Road landfill is back-fence neighbor to the Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major stop on the NASCAR circuit. Races would be held there this weekend and next. Local print and broadcast coverage was extensive. Even I knew that tomorrow&#x2019;s qualifying would determine which lucky drivers made the cut for Saturday&#x2019;s All-Star Race.<br> <br>Two hundred thousand avid fans would pour into Charlotte for Race Week. Looking at the sea of SUVs, campers, pickups, and sedans, I guessed that many had already hit town.<br> <br>Warner rode the shoulder. I followed, ignoring the hostile glares of those cemented in the logjam.<br> <br>Lights flashing, we snaked through the bedlam on Bruton Smith Boulevard, past the dragway, the dirt track, and a zillion fast-food joints. On the sidelines, the tattooed and tank-topped carried babies, six-packs, coolers, and radios. Vendors sold souvenirs from folding tables beneath improvised tents.<br> <br>Warner looped the surrealistic geometry of the Speedway itself, made several turns, then rolled to a stop outside a small structure whose siding might once have been blue. Beyond the building loomed a series of mounds resembling a Martian mountain range.<br> <br>A man emerged and issued Warner a yellow hard hat and a neon orange vest. As they talked, the man pointed at a gravel road rising sharply uphill.<br> <br>Warner waited while I received my safety gear, then we proceeded up the slope. Trucks rumbled in both directions, engines churning hard going in, humming going out.<br> <br>When the road leveled, I could see three men standing by an enormous Dumpster. Two wore coveralls. The third wore black pants and a long-sleeved black shirt over a white tee. Joe Hawkins, longtime death investigator for the MCME. All three featured gear identical to that lying on my passenger seat.<br> <br>Warner nosed up to the Dumpster and parked. I pulled in beside him.<br> <br>The men watched as I got out and donned my hard hat and vest. Fetching. A perfect complement to my current state of hygiene.<br> <br>&#x201c;We gotta quit meeting like this.&#x201d; Joe and I had parted at the sandpit barely an hour earlier.<br> <br>The older man stuck out a hand. &#x201c;Weaver Molene.&#x201d; He was flushed and sweating and filled his coveralls way beyond their intended capacity.<br> <br>&#x201c;Temperance Brennan.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d have skipped the handshake, given the black moons under Molene&#x2019;s nails, but didn&#x2019;t want to be rude.<br> <br>&#x201c;You the coroner?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I work for the medical examiner,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Molene introduced the younger man as Barcelona Jackson. Jackson was very thin and very black. And very, very nervous.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jackson and I work for the company that manages the landfill.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Impressive pile of trash,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Site&#x2019;s got a capacity of over two and a half million cubic meters.&#x201d; Molene ran a dingy hankie across his face. &#x201c;Friggin&#x2019; weird Jackson stumbled onto the one square foot holding a stiff. Or maybe not. Probably dozens out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson had mostly kept his eyes down. At Molene&#x2019;s words, he raised and then quickly dropped them back to his boots.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me what you found, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though I spoke to Jackson, Molene answered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably best we show you. And quick.&#x201d; He pocket-jammed the hankie. &#x201c;This storm&#x2019;s coming fast.&#x201d;<br> <br>Molene set off at a pace I would have thought impossible for a man of his bulk. Jackson scampered after. I fell into line, paying attention as best I could to the uneven footing. Warner and Hawkins brought up the rear.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve excavated in landfills, am familiar with the aroma of eau de dump, a delicate blend of methane and carbon dioxide with traces of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, hydrogen chloride, and carbon monoxide added for spice. I braced for the stench. Didn&#x2019;t happen.<br> <br>Good odor management, guys. Or maybe it was Mother Nature. Wind swirled dirt into little cyclones and tumbled cellophane wrappers, plastic bags, and torn paper across the landscape.<br> <br>Our course took us the length of the active landfill, down a slope, then around a series of what appeared to be closed areas. Instead of raw earth, the tops of the older mounds were covered with grass.<br> <br>As we walked, the rumble of trucks receded, and the whine of fine-tuned engines grew louder. Based on the changing acoustics, I figured the Speedway lay over a rise to our right.<br> <br>After ten minutes, Molene stopped at the base of a truncated hillock. Though tentative grass greened the top, the side facing us was scarred and pitted, like a desert butte gouged by eons of wind.<br> <br>Molene said something I didn&#x2019;t catch. I was focused on the exposed stratigraphy.<br> <br>Unlike the sandstone or shale that make up metamorphic rock, the mound&#x2019;s layers were composed of flattened Pontiacs and Posturepedics, of squashed Pepsis, Pop-Tarts, Pringles, and Pampers.<br> <br>Molene pointed to a crater in a brown-green layer eight feet above our heads, then to an object lying about two yards off the base of the mound. His explanation was lost to a clap of thunder.<br> <br>Didn&#x2019;t matter. It was obvious Jackson&#x2019;s &#x201c;stiff&#x201d; had dropped from the mound, probably dislodged by the previous day&#x2019;s storm.<br> <br>I crossed to the thing and squatted. Molene, Warner, and Hawkins clustered around me but remained standing. Jackson kept his distance.<br> <br>The object was a drum, approximately twenty inches in diameter and thirty inches high. Its cover lay off to one side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like a metal container of some kind,&#x201d; I said without looking up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too rusted to make out a logo or label.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Flip it,&#x201d; Molene shouted. &#x201c;Jackson and I turned the thing bottom up to protect the stuff inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tried. It weighed a ton.<br> <br>Hawkins squatted, and together, we muscled the drum upright. Its interior was filled with a solid black mass.<br> <br>I leaned close. Something pale was suspended in the dark fill, but the pre-storm gloom obscured all detail.<br> <br>I was reaching for my Maglite when lightning sparked.<br> <br>A human hand flashed white in the electric brilliance.<br> <br>Dissolved to black.<br> <br>� 2011 Temperance Brennan, L.P.</p><h2>The Santaland Diaries / Season&#39;s Greetings: 2 Plays</h2><p>1998 stapled-wraps SOFTCOVER</p><p></p><h2>The Wayward Bus</h2><p>The Wayward Bus travelled the backroads through the lush California countryside. Its driver was a man of the land - lusty, hot-blooded and uninhibited. On the bus was a girl who danced at stag parties, a travelling salesman strictly out for fun, a boy coming into manhood and a college girl pursuing her secret, passionate quest. This is a story of crisis and passion, of love and longing. In many ways it is one of Steinbeck&#39;s most powerful novels, not least because it shows just how profound his knowledge of human beings and their emotions is.</p><p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).</p><p>&nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B.

Published in February 1947, &#x201c;the Bus,&#x201d; as Steinbeck referred to it in his letters, was his first long and much-anticipated novel after <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> eight years earlier and his last big novel before <i>East of Eden</i> five years later. With ten major characters, however, the novel&#x2019;s unconventional ensemble cast or its unorthodox moral code or its overtly allegorical form may have limited its popularity. But make no mistake: &#x201c;The Bus&#x201d; is a major novel by a major American author and it deserves to attract a new generation of readers.</p><p>Steinbeck struck on the premise for the story in Mexico in the spring of 1945 while completing <i>The Pearl</i>. Originally he thought he would develop the idea in a tale of picaresque adventure &#x201c;something like the Don Quixote of Mexico&#x201d; or in a short novel the length of <i>The Red Pony</i> (1937). Gradually, however, the story of these pilgrims and their journey swelled into an ambitious novel of more than a hundred thousand words. As he wrote his friend and editor Pascal Covici from Cuernavaca on July 12, 1945, &#x201c;The more I think of it the better I like it and the better I like it the longer its plan and the wider its scope until it seems to contain the whole world. From the funny little story it is growing to the most ambitious thing I have ever attempted. Not that it still won&#x2019;t be funny but funny as Tom Jones and Tristram Shandy and Don Quixote are funny. And it isn&#x2019;t going to take a little time to write but a long time and I don&#x2019;t care, for my bus is something large in my mind. It is a cosmic bus holding sparks and back firing into the Milky Way and turning the corner of Betelgeuse without a hand signal. And Juan Chicoy the driver is all the gods the father you ever saw driving a six cylinder broken down, battered world through time and space. If I can do it well The Wayward Bus will be a pleasant thing.&#x201d; What a whaling ship and a man of war were for Herman Melville and Jack London, what a stagecoach was for John Ford, a bus was for John Steinbeck. His wayward bus &#x201c;Sweetheart&#x201d; is the lineal ancestor of Ken Kesey&#x2019;s psychedelic bus &#x201c;Further,&#x201d; another conveyance that would backfire into the Milky Way a generation later.</p><p>As for the title: The first synopsis of the story, Steinbeck remembered, &#x201c;was written in Spanish&#x201d; and &#x201c;was called El Cami�n Vacilador. The word vacilador, or the verb vacilar, is not translatable unfortunately, and it&#x2019;s a word we really need in English because to be &#x2018;vacilando&#x2019; means that you&#x2019;re aiming at some place, but you don&#x2019;t care much whether you get there. We don&#x2019;t have such a word in English. Wayward has an overtone of illic itness or illegality, based of course on medieval lore where wayward men were vagabonds. But vacilador is not a vagabond at all. Wayward was the nearest English word that I could find.&#x201d;</p><p>Steinbeck wrote much of the novel at his kitchen table in New York &#x201c;amid jampots and pieces of cold toast and stale coffee,&#x201d; and he destroyed &#x201c;about 20,000 words&#x201d; in January 1946 because he was dissatisfied with them. In May 1946 he reported that &#x201c;For two months I&#x2019;ve been fighting the Bus and only now have I got a start which seems good. I&#x2019;ve thrown away thousands of words. But I think it is good now. And at least it is moving.&#x201d; He finished a draft in October 1946. In all, he spent nearly two years crafting the novel. Despite assertions that his writing was uneven, Steinbeck&#x2019;s work on the story was not haphazard. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t any idea as to whether it is any good or not,&#x201d; he admitted to friends. &#x201c;But the people in it are alive, so much so that sometimes they take a tack I didn&#x2019;t suspect they were going to.&#x201d; &#x201c;I hope you will like it,&#x201d; Steinbeck wrote his boyhood friend Jack Wagner, &#x201c;although &#x2018;like&#x2019; is not the word to use. You nor anyone can&#x2019;t <i>like</i> it. But at least I think it is effective. It is interesting to me&#x2014;. . . This book depends on mood, on detail and on all the little factors of writing for its effectiveness. It has practically no story.&#x201d; He elsewhere allowed that &#x201c;It is what I wanted to say and I think it is in there for anyone who really wants to find it and there&#x2019;s a top story for those who don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; As Steinbeck predicted, &#x201c;It will be called simple character study and that is only the littlest part of what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Published to great fanfare, <i>The Wayward Bus</i> was an immediate bestseller. It enjoyed a first printing of 750,000 copies and was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Two weeks before its formal release on February 15, Steinbeck reported that &#x201c;The advance sale of the Bus are stupendous. Something near to a million copies. . . . This is completely fantastic. The people who are going to attack it are buying it like mad.&#x201d; Steinbeck&#x2019;s observation was prescient. The novel received contradictory or mixed notices at best. &#x201c;The reviews of the Bus out today,&#x201d; the author again wrote Wagner. &#x201c;I should never read reviews, good or bad. They just confuse me because they cancel each other out and end up by meaning nothing. I should let them alone. The book is getting good notices mostly here [New York], although a couple of my congenital enemies are sniping. That is good for a book. The more arguments the better.&#x201d; On the one hand, for example, the novel was hailed by Harrison Smith in the <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i>: &#x201c;It stands by itself, the work of a writer as distinctively American as Mark Twain, who has developed in power and dramatic talent for almost twenty years.&#x201d; It was also saluted by Carlos Baker, professor of English at Princeton University, in the <i>New York Times</i>: &#x201c;This modern version of a medieval palimpsest will provide, for the thoughtful, one more handle to Steinbeck&#x2019;s parable of Everyman.&#x201d; Yet Frank O&#x2019;Malley scorned the novel in <i>Commonweal</i>, a Catholic weekly. O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s hyperbolic review was particularly savage: &#x201c;Steinbeck&#x2019;s dreary, prurient pilgrimage has no real human or universal significance. It is nothing more than an unusually dismal bus ride&#x2014;more dismal, depraved and meaningless than any man anywhere has ever taken.&#x201d; Harry Hansen in <i>Survey Graphic</i> was even more caustic: &#x201c;Another load of sleazy characters who deserved oblivion rather than the accolade of a book club.&#x201d; A year later, Steinbeck wrote Covici that he hoped &#x201c;some time some people will know what the <i>Bus</i> was about. Even with the lead, they didn&#x2019;t discover.&#x201d;</p><p>The &#x201c;lead&#x201d; to which Steinbeck referred, of course, was the epigram to the fable from the late-fifteenth-century English morality play <i>Everyman</i>. &#x201c;The Bus&#x201d; is a moralizing book, even if its moral is neither obvious nor particularly reassuring. Like a medieval morality play or any drama constructed according to the classical &#x201c;unities&#x201d; (including Eugene O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s <i>Long Day&#x2019;s Journey into Night</i>), Steinbeck&#x2019;s story transpires in the course of a single day, opening before dawn in the lunchroom at Rebel Corners and ending after dusk as the bus nears its destination of San Juan de la Cruz (Saint John of the Cross). Moreover, just as the characters in <i>Everyman</i> are personifications (for example, Beauty, Strength, Fellowship, Good Deeds), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> is a type of allegory temporally set in spring, the traditional season of pilgrimages, with archetypal or representative figures whose names denote their roles. Though Steinbeck had originally set the story in Mexico, he transferred it to his familiar Salinas Valley, where he was born and lived the first eighteen years of his life. Still, none of the place names in the novel, with the notable exceptions of such southern cities as Los Angeles, Hollywood, and San Diego, refer to actual sites. There is a Santa Cruz, California, of course, but no San Juan de la Cruz, as in the novel; and there is a San Ysidro, California, but it is located in San Diego County, nowhere near the San Ysidro of the story. Put another way, Steinbeck moved his narrative from Mexico to an imaginary central California because the novel is, at its top or most literal level, a commentary on post-World War II America.</p><p>Steinbeck establishes the parameters of his topical satire in the opening pages of the novel. The crossroads of Rebel Corners, where Juan and Alice Chicoy run the garage and lunchroom, was established during the Civil War. After the war its founders, Confederate sympathizers named Blankens&#x2014;ciphers destined to disappear, as their name implies&#x2014;became &#x201c;lazy and quarrelsome and full of hatred and complaints, as every defeated nation does.&#x201d; The novel appeared early in the cold war, of course, in the midst of a national debate over policy toward the defeated Axis powers. Only weeks later Secretary of State George C. Marshall would propose the European Reconstruction Act, better known as the Marshall Plan, designed to help European nations recover from the ravages of World War II and to contain Soviet expansion. The novel also contains a number of incidental references to World War II&#x2014;to the draft, to rationing, to wage and price controls, as well as a subtle allusion in the first chapter to &#x201c;Atom ites,&#x201d; a new race of people who live in the shadow of a mushroom cloud. As Steinbeck wrote in his last book <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), &#x201c;Under the pressure of war we finally made the atom bomb, and for reasons which seemed justifiable at the time we dropped it on two Japanese cities&#x2014;and I think we finally frightened ourselves.&#x201d; In the dialogue between Elliott Pritchard and the army veteran Ernest Horton in chapter 9, Steinbeck also glosses the then-current debate over how to integrate the discharged soldiers into a domestic economy most Americans believed was doomed to plunge into recession with the end of the war. In this sense, Steinbeck&#x2019;s novel considers the predicament of the returning soldiers much like William Wyler&#x2019;s movie <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i> (1946).</p><p>Steinbeck also recognizes other major social changes endemic to the postwar period: increasing commercialization, especially the commercialization of sex, and the new roles available to women. The lunchroom at Rebel Corners is decorated with calendar girls and Coca-Cola posters picturing beautiful women. Despite their brand name, Mother Mahoney&#x2019;s home-baked pies are baked in a factory, and Mother Mahoney, like Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker, is a figment of an advertiser&#x2019;s imagination. With a sort of rugged realism, Steinbeck insists on specifying the brands of cola drinks, candy bars, and cigarettes and the names of upscale Hollywood restaurants and hotels. Elliott Pritchard&#x2019;s gold nail pick, watch, and key chain and his wife Bernice&#x2019;s &#x201c;three-quarter-length black fox coat&#x201d; perfect...</p></p><h2>Sermon in a Sentence: A Treasury of Quotes on the Spiritual Life from St. Therese of Lisieux : Doctor of the Church</h2><p>This deluxe book contains a collection of hundreds of direct quotes and short sayings of St. Therese, carefully arranged by the major virtues of the Christian life.

These abstract figures, usually with the grain heads still attached, are the basis of the projects in this book. Wheat stems are woven into wall or door decorations using macrame techniques. The simpler ones may also be hung outdoors as an offering for the birds. A "preparations" chapter discusses the different kinds of grain that may be used and supplies needed for the work. The projects that follow are inspired by designs from many countries and have step-by-step instructions with excellent color photographs of the finished items.

Perhaps they married too young and started a family too early. Maybe Frank's job <i>is </i>dull. And April never saw herself as a housewife. Yet they have always lived on the assumption that greatness is only just around the corner. But now that certainty is about to crumble.With heartbreaking compassion and remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their spiritual birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves.</p><p>The rediscovery and rejuvenation of Richard Yates's 1961 novel <i>Revolutionary Road</i> is due in large part to its continuing emotional and moral resonance for an early 21st-century readership. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, ostensibly thriving couple living with their two children in a prosperous Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. However, like the characters in John Updike's similarly themed <i>Couples</i>, the self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. As their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfillment are thrown into jeopardy. <p> Yates's incisive, moving, and often very funny prose weaves a tale that is at once a fascinating period piece and a prescient anticipation of the way we live now. Many of the cultural motifs seem quaintly dated--the early-evening cocktails, Frank's illicit lunch breaks with his secretary, the way Frank isn't averse to knocking April around when she speaks out of turn--and yet the quiet desperation at thwarted dreams reverberates as much now as it did years ago.

Featuring 100 fabulous recipes from the first three seasons of the show, including dishes from the Elimination Rounds and the Quick-Fire Challenges, <em>Top Chef: The Cookbook</em> invites fans into the hottest kitchen on prime time. In-depth discussions with contestants, judges, and crew reveal the inner workings of the show, and lavish photographs take readers behind-the-scenes into the <em>Top Chef</em> pantry and the competition sites. Handsomely packaged with a canvas cover inspired by the chef's jacket worn by each of the <em>Top Chef</em> contestants, this cookbook will have aspiring culinary contenders reliving classic show moments and relishing new recipes just in time to obsess over Padma's outfits in Season 4.</p><p>In addition to his job as lead judge on Top Chef, Tom Colicchio is one of America&#39;s most influential chefs. He won the James Beard Award as the best chef in New York when he was at Gramercy Tavern. He is currently the chef/owner of Craft in New York and Craftsteak in Las Vegas. His seminal cookbook Think Like a Chef won the James Beard Cookbook Award.Part fanzine, part cookbook, this volume will appeal to the anyone who tunes into Top Chef each week to see contestants out-cook each other, using vending-machine ingredients to make appetizers or preparing lunch for the cast of a telenovela. Replete with dozens of glamour shots of contestant/contributors and sweetly old-fashioned profiles of the judges (host Padma Lakshmi is "a no-nonsense kind of gal"), this volume feels like a guide to a strange, food-obsessed cult. The author sighs over pretty, eccentric Betty Fraser, "it was always hard to know what to make of Betty," and notes that season two winner Ilan Hall was "good at falling into the kind of cliquish drama you might find in a high school cafeteria." The recipes themselves, taken directly from the show's "quickfire" and elimination challenges, are dauntingly involved, much more suited to cooking competitions than the average home kitchen: they never use one ingredient when three will do, nor do they shy away from expensive options like foie gras, truffles and abalone. Even simple-sounding dishes like Chiles Rellenos are accented with complicated sauces and garnishes. It's hard to imagine anyone consulting this book to whip up dinner, but it's easy to see how a Top Chef obsessive would get much satisfaction out of it, if not necessarily a full stomach. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. &#34;The Everlasting Man&#34; is a work of Christian apologetics first published in 1925. Chesterton intended it to some extent as a deliberate rebuttal to H. G. Wells&#39; &#34;The Outline of History&#34;, disputing Wells&#39; portrayals of human life and civilization as a seamless development from animal life and of Jesus Christ as merely another charismatic figure. Whereas Orthodoxy detailed Chesterton&#39;s own spiritual journey, in this book he tries to illustrate the spiritual journey of humanity, or at least of Western civilization. C. S. Lewis credited &#34;The Everlasting Man&#34; with &#34;baptizing&#34; his intellect, much as George MacDonald&#39;s writings had baptized his imagination, so as to make him more than half-converted well before he could bring himself to embrace Christianity. In a 1950 letter to Sheldon Vanauken, Lewis calls the book &#34;the best popular apologetic I know,&#34; and in 1947 he wrote to Rhonda Bodle: &#34;the [very] best popular defense of the full Christian position I know is G. K. Chesterton&#39;s &#34;The Everlasting Man.&#34; The book was also cited by The Christian Century in a list of 10 books that &#34;most shaped [Lewis&#39;] vocational attitude and philosophy of life&#34;.</p><p>What, if anything, is it that makes the human uniquely human? This, in part, is the question that G.K. Chesterton starts with in this classic exploration of human history. Responding to the evolutionary materialism of his contemporary (and antagonist) H.G. Wells, Chesterton in this work affirms human uniqueness and the unique message of the Christian faith. Writing in a time when social Darwinism was rampant, Chesterton instead argued that the idea that society has been steadily progressing from a state of primitivism and barbarity towards civilization is simply and flatly inaccurate. "Barbarism and civilization were not successive stages in the progress of the world," he affirms, with arguments drawn from the histories of both Egypt and Babylon. <p> As always with Chesterton, there is in this analysis something (as he said of Blake) "very plain and emphatic." He sees in Christianity a rare blending of philosophy and mythology, or reason and story, which satisfies both the mind and the heart. On both levels it rings true. As he puts it, "in answer to the historical query of why it was accepted, and is accepted, I answer for millions of others in my reply; because it fits the lock; because it is like life." Here, as so often in Chesterton, we sense a lived, awakened faith. All that he writes derives from a keen intellect guided by the heart's own knowledge. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English writer whose prolific and diverse output included philosophy, ontology, poetry, plays, journalism, public lectures and debates, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, including fantasy and detective fiction.</p><h2>Twelve Dancing Princesses: Princess of the Silver Woods</h2><p>When Petunia, the youngest of King Gregor&#39;s twelve dancing daughters, is invited to visit an elderly friend in the neighboring country of Westfalin, she welcomes the change of scenery.

She and her husband, Earl, live in the mountains of North Carolina.A new hardcover edition (after Dutton's in 1966) of the first in a series that now totals 19 (The Cat Who Tailed a Thief, 1997, etc.). Here, Braun introduces Jim Qwilleran, a prizewinning reporter who's been on the skids but is now coming back with a job as feature writer (mostly on the art scene) for the Daily Fluxion. George Bonifield Mountclemens, the paper's credentialed art critic, writes almost invariably scathing, hurtful reviews of local shows; delivers his pieces by messenger; lives with his all-knowing cat Koko in a lushly furnished house in a moldering neighborhood, and has a raft of enemies all over town. He offers the newcomer a tiny apartment in his building at a nominal rent, and Qwilleran grabs it, surmising the deal will involve lots of cat-sitting. Meanwhile, a gallery whose artists get happier treatment from Mountclemens is owned by Earl Lambreth. The acerbic critic has praised paintings there by a reclusive Italian named Scrano; the junk assemblages of Nino, who calls himself a ``Thingist,'' as well as works by Lambreth's attractive wife Zoe. It's Zoe who, one night past closing, finds her husband stabbed to death in the vandalized gallery. Days later, Qwilleran, guided by an insistent Koko, finds Mountclemens's knifed corpse on the patio behind his house. It takes a while to put the meandering pieces together and to uncover an overriding motive behind the mayhem, but the best things here are Qwilleran's low-keyed charisma and the author's well- aimed, often funny barbs at the pretensions of the contemporary art world--as on-target today as they were some 30 years ago. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The latest novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Philippa Gregory features one of the most famous girls in history, Lady Jane Grey, and her two sisters, each of whom dared to defy her queen. Seventeen-year-old Jane Grey was queen of England for nine days. Her father and his allies crowned her instead of the dead king&#39;s half-sister Mary Tudor, who quickly mustered an army, claimed her throne, and locked Jane in the Tower of London. When Jane refused to betray her Protestant faith, Mary sent her to the executioner&#39;s block, where Jane transformed her father&#39;s greedy power-grab into tragic martyrdom. &#34;Learn you to die,&#34; was the advice Jane wrote to her younger sister Katherine, who has no intention of dying. She intends to enjoy her beauty and her youth and fall in love. But she is heir to the insecure and infertile Queen Mary and then to her sister Queen Elizabeth, who will never allow Katherine to marry and produce a Tudor son. When Katherine&#39;s pregnancy betrays her secret marriage she faces imprisonment in the Tower, only yards from her sister&#39;s scaffold. &#34;Farewell, my sister,&#34; writes Katherine to the youngest Grey sister, Mary. A beautiful dwarf, disregarded by the court, Mary keeps family secrets, especially her own, while avoiding Elizabeth&#39;s suspicious glare. After seeing her sisters defy the queen, Mary is acutely aware of her own danger, but determined to command her own life. What will happen when the last Tudor defies her ruthless and unforgiving cousin Queen Elizabeth?</p><p></p><h2>PDR Pocket Guide to Prescription Drugs, 9th Edition</h2><p><p> <b>Everything you need to know about<br> prescription drugs -- based on the<br> FDA-approved information published<br> in the <i>Physicians' Desk Reference</i>�</b> <br> </p><p> <i>Why was this drug prescribed for me?<br> What are the benefits and risks of taking this drug?<br> Are there any side effects I should watch for?<br> What questions should I ask my doctor<br> about this prescription?</i> <br> </p><p> You'll find the answers to all these questions and more in this accessible, up-to-date resource.

Tappan Adney, a New York journalist, was dispatched to the Yukon in 1897, at the height of the gold fever, to "furnish news and pictures of the new gold fields," Adney joined the northward migration, chronicling the day-to-day experiences of the stampeders. He moved comfortably among the would-be miners, recounting their stories, the sights along the route, and the hopes and feards of the many men - and handful of women - who shared his journey to the gold fields.<br><br>The book contains excellent descriptions of the people, places, events, and experiences of the Klondike stampede. The account ot the Klondike gold fields, which includes pragmatic discussions of such things as ming techniques, cabin-building, and the operation of dog teams, is solid, reliable, and facinating. Adney was not only a good writer, he was also an accomplished photographer, and there are over 150 photographs and drawings in the text, adding an important visual dimension to the book.<br><br>After it came out, <i>The Klondike Stampede</i> rarely received the attention it deserved, although northern specialists have long found much of value in its pages.

He spent sixteen months in the Klondike, living and travelling with the stampeders. He returned to the north in 1900 to cover the Nome, Alaska, gold rush. He later moved to Woodstock, New Brunswick, where he died in 1950."In <i>The Klondike Stampede</i>, Tappan Adney brings the seasoned eye of an experienced and competent journalist to the task of recording an extraordinary event . . . Adney did not succumb to the tendency toward overstatement and exaggeration that is so common among the Klondike accounts. Instead, he captured, vividly and convincingly, in words and images, one of the more remarkable events of the nineteenth century."&#x2015;Ken Coates, University of Northern British Columbia</p><h2>The Perfect Hope (The Inn Boonsboro Trilogy)</h2><p>The Montgomery brothers have been the talk of Boonsboro, ever since they decided to renovate the old inn into an intimate and handsome new bed and breakfast.

Under the star-washed sky its stone walls glowed, rising up over Boonsboro&#x2019;s Square as they had for more than two centuries. Even the crossroads held quiet now, stretching out in pools of shadows and light. All the windows and storefronts along Main Street seemed to sleep, content to doze away in the balm of the summer night.</p><p>She should do the same, Hope thought. Settle down, stretch out. Sleep.</p><p>That would be the sensible thing to do, and she considered herself a sensible woman. But the long day had left her restless, and&#x2014;she reminded herself&#x2014;Carolee would arrive bright and early to start breakfast.</p><p>The innkeeper could sleep in.</p><p>In any case, it was barely midnight. When she&#x2019;d lived and worked in Georgetown, she&#x2019;d rarely managed to settle in for the night this early. Of course, then she&#x2019;d been managing the Wickham, and if she hadn&#x2019;t been dealing with some small crisis or handling a guest request, she&#x2019;d been enjoying the nightlife.</p><p>The town of Boonsboro, tucked into the foothills of Maryland&#x2019;s Blue Ridge Mountains, might have a rich and storied history, it certainly had its charms&#x2014;among which she counted the revitalized inn she now managed&#x2014;but it wasn&#x2019;t famed for its nightlife.</p><p>That would change a bit when her friend Avery opened her restaurant and tap house. And wouldn&#x2019;t it be fun to see what the energetic Avery MacTavish did with her new enterprise right next door&#x2014;and just across The Square from Avery&#x2019;s pizzeria.</p><p>Before summer ended, Avery would juggle the running of two restaurants, Hope thought.</p><p>And people called <i>her</i> an overachiever.</p><p>She looked around the kitchen&#x2014;clean, shiny, warm, and welcoming. She&#x2019;d already sliced fruit, checked the supplies, restocked the refrigerator. So everything sat ready for Carolee to prepare breakfast for the guests currently tucked in their rooms.</p><p>She&#x2019;d finished her paperwork, checked all the doors, and made her rounds checking for dishes&#x2014;or anything else out of place. Duties done, she told herself, and still she wasn&#x2019;t ready to tuck her own self in her third-floor apartment.</p><p>Instead, she poured an indulgent glass of wine and did a last circle through The Lobby, switching off the chandelier over the central table with its showy summer flowers.</p><p>She moved through the arch, gave the front door one last check before she turned toward the stairs. Her fingers trailed lightly over the iron banister.</p><p>She&#x2019;d already checked The Library, but she checked again. It wasn&#x2019;t anal, she told herself. A guest might have slipped in for a glass of Irish or a book. But the room was quiet, settled like the rest.</p><p>She glanced back. She had guests on this floor. Mr. and Mrs. Vargas&#x2014;Donna and Max&#x2014;married twenty-seven years. The night at the inn, in Nick and Nora, had been a birthday gift for Donna from their daughter. And wasn&#x2019;t that sweet?</p><p>Her other guests, a floor up in Westley and Buttercup, chose the inn for their wedding night. She liked to think the newlyweds, April and Troy, would take lovely, lasting memories with them.</p><p>She checked the door to the second-level porch, then on impulse unlocked it and stepped out into the night.</p><p>With her wine, she crossed the wide wood deck, leaned on the rail. Across The Square, the apartment above Vesta sat dark&#x2014;and empty now that Avery had moved in with Owen Montgomery. She could admit&#x2014;to herself anyway&#x2014;she missed looking over and knowing her friend was right there, just across Main.</p><p>But Avery was exactly where she belonged, Hope decided, with Owen&#x2014;her first and, as it turned out, her last boyfriend.</p><p>Talk about sweet.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d help plan a wedding&#x2014;May bride, May flowers&#x2014;right there in The Courtyard, just as Clare&#x2019;s had been this past spring.</p><p>Thinking of it, Hope looked down Main toward the bookstore. Clare&#x2019;s Turn The Page had been a risk for a young widow with two children and another on the way. But she&#x2019;d made it work. Clare had a knack for making things work. Now she was Clare Montgomery, Beckett&#x2019;s wife. And when winter came again, they&#x2019;d welcome a new baby to the mix.</p><p>Odd, wasn&#x2019;t it, that her two friends had lived right in Boonsboro for so long, and she&#x2019;d relocated only the year&#x2014;not even a full year yet&#x2014;before. The new kid in town.</p><p>Now, of the three of them, she was the only one still right here, right in the heart of town.</p><p>Silly to miss them when she saw them nearly every day, but on restless nights she could wish, just a little, they were still close.</p><p>So much had changed, for all of them, in this past year.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been perfectly content in Georgetown, with her home, her work, her routine. With Jonathan, the cheating bastard.</p><p>She&#x2019;d had good, solid plans, no rush, no hurry, but solid plans. The Wickham had been her place. She&#x2019;d known its rhythm, its tones, its needs. And she&#x2019;d done a hell of a job for the Wickhams, and their cheating bastard son, Jonathan.</p><p>She&#x2019;d planned to marry him. No, there&#x2019;d been no formal engagement, no concrete promises, but marriage and future had been on the table.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t a moron.</p><p>And all the time&#x2014;or at least in the last several months&#x2014;they&#x2019;d been together, with him sharing her bed, or her sharing his, he&#x2019;d been seeing someone else. Someone of his more elevated social strata you could say, she mused, with lingering bitterness. Someone who wouldn&#x2019;t work ten- and twelve-hour days, and often more&#x2014;to manage the exclusive hotel, but who&#x2019;d stay there, in its most elaborate suite, of course.</p><p>No, she wasn&#x2019;t a moron, but she&#x2019;d been far too trusting and humiliatingly shocked when Jonathan told her he would be announcing his engagement&#x2014;to someone else&#x2014;the next day.</p><p>Humiliatingly shocked, she thought again, particularly as they&#x2019;d been naked and in her bed at the time.</p><p>Then again, he&#x2019;d been shocked, too, when she&#x2019;d ordered him to get the hell out. He genuinely hadn&#x2019;t understood why anything between them should change.</p><p>That single moment ushered in a lot of change.</p><p>Now she was Inn BoonsBoro&#x2019;s innkeeper, living in a small town in Western Maryland, a good clip from the bright lights of the big city.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t spend what free time she had planning clever little dinner parties, or shopping in the boutiques for the perfect shoes for the perfect dress for the next event.</p><p>Did she miss all that? Her go-to boutique, her favorite lunch spot, the lovely high ceilings and flower-framed little patio of her own town house? Or the pressure and excitement of preparing the hotel for visits from dignitaries, celebrities, business moguls?</p><p>Sometimes, she admitted. But not as often as she&#x2019;d expected to, and not as much as she&#x2019;d assumed she would.</p><p>Because she had been content in her personal life, challenged in her professional one, and the Wickham had been her place. But she&#x2019;d discovered something in the last few months. Here, she wasn&#x2019;t just content, but happy. The inn wasn&#x2019;t just her place, it was <i>home</i>.</p><p>She had her friends to thank for that, and the Montgomery brothers along with their mother. Justine Montgomery had hired her on the spot. At the time Hope hadn&#x2019;t known Justine well enough to be surprised by her quick offer. But she did know herself, and continued to be surprised at her own fast, impulsive acceptance.</p><p>Zero to sixty? More like zero to ninety and still going.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t regret the impulse, the decision, the move.</p><p>Fresh starts hadn&#x2019;t been in the plan, but she was good at adjusting plans. Thanks to the Montgomerys, the lovingly&#x2014;and effortfully&#x2014;restored inn was her home and her career.</p><p>She wandered the porch, checking the hanging planters, adjusting&#x2014;minutely&#x2014;the angle of a bistro chair.</p><p>&#x201c;And I love every square inch of it,&#x201d; she murmured.</p><p>One of the porch doors leading out from Elizabeth and Darcy opened. The scent of honeysuckle drifted on the night air.</p><p>Someone else was restless, Hope thought. Then again, she didn&#x2019;t know if ghosts slept. She doubted if the spirit Beckett had named Elizabeth for the room she favored would tell her if she asked. Thus far, Lizzy hadn&#x2019;t deigned to speak to her inn-mate.</p><p>Hope smiled at the term, sipped her wine.</p><p>&#x201c;Lovely night. I was just thinking how different my life is now, and all things considered, how glad I am it is.&#x201d; She spoke in an easy, friendly way. After all, the research she and Owen had done so far on their permanent guest had proven Lizzy&#x2014;or Eliza Ford when she&#x2019;d lived&#x2014;was one of Hope&#x2019;s ancestors.</p><p>Family, to Hope&#x2019;s mind, ought to be easy and friendly.</p><p>&#x201c;We have newlyweds in W&amp;B. They look so happy, so fresh and new somehow. The couple in N&amp;N are here celebrating her fifty-eighth birthday. They don&#x2019;t look new, but they do look happy, and so nice and comfortable. I like giving them a special place to stay, a special experience. It&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m good at.&#x201d;</p><p>Silence held, but Hope could <i>feel</i> the presence. Companionable, she realized. Oddly companionable. Just a couple of women up late, looking out at the night.</p><p>&#x201c;Carolee will be here early. She&#x2019;s doing breakfast tomorrow, and I have the morning off. So.&#x201d; She lifted her glass. &#x201c;Some wine, some introspection, some feeling sorry for myself circling around to realizing I have nothing to feel sorry for myself for.&#x201d; With a smile, Hope sipped again. &#x201c;So, a good glass of wine.</p><p>&#x201c;Now that I&#x2019;ve accomplished all that, I should get to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Still she lingered a little longer in the quiet summer night, with the scent of honeysuckle drifting around her.</p><p>WHEN HOPE CAME down in the morning, the scent was fresh coffee, grilled bacon&#x2014;and, if her nose didn&#x2019;t deceive her, Carolee&#x2019;s apple-cinnamon pancakes. She heard easy conversation in The Dining Room. Donna and Max, talking about poking around town before driving home.</p><p>Hope went down the hall, circled to the kitchen to see if Carolee needed a hand. Justine&#x2019;s sister had her bright blond hair clipped short for summer, with the addition of flirty bangs over her cheerful hazel eyes. They beamed at Hope even as she wagged a finger.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing down here, young lady?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nearly ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And your morning off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which I spent&#x2014;so far&#x2014;sleeping until eight, doing yoga, and putzing.&#x201d; She helped herself to a mug of coffee, closed her own deep brown eyes as she sipped. &#x201c;My first cup of the day. Why is it always the best?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I knew. I&#x2019;m still trying to switch to tea. My Darla&#x2019;s on a health kick and doing her best to drag me along.&#x201d; Carolee spoke of her daughter with affection laced with exasperation. &#x201c;I really like our Titania and Oberon blend. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s not coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing is but coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said it. She can&#x2019;t wait for the new gym to open. She says if I don&#x2019;t sign up for yoga classes, she&#x2019;s signing me up and carting me over there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love yoga.&#x201d; Hope laughed at the doubt&#x2014;and anxiety&#x2014;on Carolee&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Honest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Carolee lifted the dishcloth again, went back to polishing the granite countertop. &#x201c;The Vargases loved the room, and as usual the bathroom&#x2014;starring the magic toilet&#x2014;got raves. I haven&#x2019;t heard a peep out of the newlyweds yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be disappointed in them if you had.&#x201d; Hope brushed at her hair. Unlike Carolee, she was experimenting with letting it grow out of the short, sharp wedge she&#x2019;d sported the last two years. The dark, glossy ends hit her jaw now, just in between enough to be annoying.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go check on Donna and Max, see if they want anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me do it,&#x201d; Hope said. &#x201c;I want to say good morning anyway, and I think I&#x2019;ll run down to TTP, say hi to Clare while it&#x2019;s still my morning off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw her last night at the book club. She&#x2019;s got the cutest baby bump. Oh, I&#x2019;ve got plenty of batter if the newlyweds want more pancakes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let them know.&#x201d;</p><p>She slipped into The Dining Room, chatted with the guests while she subtly checked to be sure there was still plenty of fresh summer berries, coffee, juice.</p><p>Once she&#x2019;d satisfied herself her guests were happy, she started back upstairs to grab her purse&#x2014;and ran into the newlyweds as they entered from the rear porch.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good morning.&#x201d; The new bride carried the afterglow of a honeymoon morning well spent. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the most beautiful room. I love everything about it. I felt like a princess bride.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you wish,&#x201d; Hope said and made them both laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so clever the way each room&#x2019;s named and decorated for romantic couples.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couples with happy endings,&#x201d; Troy reminded her, and got a slow, dreamy smile from his bride.</p><p>&#x201c;Like us.

But while we know the agony of a sunburn or the comfort of our winter heaters, do we really understand heat?<br><br>A bestselling scientist and nature writer who goes to any extreme to uncover the answers, Bill Streever sets off to find out what heat really means. Let him be your guide and you'll firewalk across hot coals and sweat it out in Death Valley, experience intense fever and fire, learn about the invention of matches and the chemistry of cooking, drink crude oil, and explore thermonuclear weapons and the hottest moment of all time-the big bang.<br><br>Written in Streever's signature spare and refreshing prose, HEAT is an adventurous personal narrative that leaves readers with a new vision of an everyday experience-how heat works, its history, and its relationship to daily life.</p><p>Bill Streever is the author of the national bestseller, <i>Cold</i>. He chairs the North Slope Science Initiative's Science Technical Advisory Panel in Alaska and serves on many related committees, including a climate change advisory panel. A biologist, he lives with his son in Anchorage, where he hikes, bikes, camps, scuba dives, and cross country skies, as often as the weather allows. <br><strong>PRAISE FOR <em>HEAT</em>:</strong><br>"Confronted in 2009 with the best-selling success of "Cold," biologist Bill Streever was all but obligated to take on "Heat," but he's done it with more verve and creativity, giving readers a virtual page-turner ... He writes cleverly, clearly, at times beautifully ... He's a friendly tour guide, with a wry sense of humor." -- <em>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</em><br><br>A "thoroughly entertaining companion volume.... Streever operates in some of the same territory as Mary Roach and Bill Bryson: taking on big, serious topics, and making them entertaining without making them trivial, inserting himself into the narrative without overwhelming the material. This is a fine balancing act." -- <em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em><br><br>"In this worthy companion to <i>Cold</i>, Streever is able to mix the pop science, personal experiences, and historic asides into a fun and informative commentary on a subject that few people think about despite its inherent life and death implications." -- <em>Publishers Weekly </em>(starred review)<br><br>"Engaging, easy-to-read, free-ranging exploration of a natural phenomenon. Funny and factual blend of science, history, and adventure." -- <em>Kirkus Reviews</em><br><br>"This book, equally engaging and filled with fascinating facts, will appeal to old and young, and likely sell like superheatedcakes." -- <em>The Huffington Post</em><br><br>"Streever's book is rangy and free-form.... Evocative scientific explanations also punctuate his exploits.... He clearly has an affinity for extremes and a gutsy, undaunted spirit that enlivens both his inquiries and his writing." -- <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i><br><br>"Bill Streever has now covered the full spectrum. As he did with his previous book, <i>Cold</i>, <i>Heat</i> reminds us that our survival depends on maintaining ourselves within a very narrow range of temperature, but Streever has gone ahead and surveyed the extremes." -- <em>The Daily Beast</em><br><br>"Bill Streever is an able guide into the flaming regions of our beleaguered evirons... a rare nature book, a pleasing mix of first-person narrative and layman science. The facts come fast and furious but are served on a platter of digestible prose." -- <em>The Minneapolis Star Tribune</em><br><br>"Streever's easy-going, colourful prose is at its best in his vivid descriptions of historical events." -- <em>The New Scientist</em><br><br>"Streever has a knack for explaining scientific phenomena to a general readership, confidently surveying both the historical development of scientific research and chemical reactions." -- <em>The New Republic</em></p><h2>Riprap and Cold Mountain Poems</h2><p>Forty-five years ago, Gary Snyder&#x2019;s first book of poems, Riprap, was published by Origin Press in a beautiful paperbound edition stitched Japanese-style.

Driskell Center</h2><p>This book is in an excellent condition.</p><p></p><h2>Looking for Carroll Beckwith: The True Stories of a Detective&#39;s Search for His Past Life</h2><p>A police commander relates the tale of how, under hypnosis, he discovered that he had a past life, describing his quest to discover the truth about Carroll Beckwith, the man he had been. ~~~ From Wikipedia: Reincarnation is the religious or philosophical concept that the soul or spirit, after biological death, begins a new life in a new body that may be human, animal or spiritual depending on the moral quality of the previous life's actions. This doctrine is a central tenet of the Indian religions. It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as Spiritism, Theosophy, and Eckankar and is found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia. ~~~ Although the majority of sects within the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Kabbalah, the Cathars, the Druze and the Rosicrucians. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism and Gnosticism of the Roman era, as well as the Indian religions, has been the subject of recent scholarly research. ~~~ In recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation. Contemporary films, books, and popular songs frequently mention reincarnation. In the last decades, academic researchers have begun to explore reincarnation and published reports of children's memories of earlier lives in peer-reviewed journals and books. ~~~ The word "reincarnation" derives from Latin, literally meaning, "entering the flesh again". The Greek equivalent metempsychosis (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3cd;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) roughly corresponds to the common English phrase "transmigration of the soul" and also usually connotes reincarnation..</p><p>This tale is improbable in more ways than one: Indianapolis police homicide commander Snow offers a dryly nonplused account of his discovery of his "past life" as 19th-century portrait painter Carroll Beckwith. Snow participated in (and taped) a therapeutic "recovered memory" session as a lark, and, once hypnotized, was jolted by a series of clear images and recollections that seemed even then strangely plausible, despite his cop's hard-nosed, empirical perspective. Later, when he walked into a New Orleans gallery at random and confronted a painting that had appeared to him in his vision, he determined to put his detective's investigative skills to work and research congruencies between his "memories" and the artist's life. Surprisingly, the evidence that he painstakingly assembled through retrieving Beckwith's journals and work from obscurity seemed fully to confirm that Snow's "recollections" were authentic. Snow relates all this ruefully, hardly eager to be perceived as "New Age." His crisp, unpretentious prose and descriptive skill go a long way in convincing one to follow his unorthodox journey. His researched account of Beckwith's lost life is impressive: Snow is remarkably sensitive to aesthetic concerns and has unearthed the compelling tale of an artist who was forced to rely on portraiture for support, and whose fast fade seemed foreordained, even as friends like John Singer Sargent found fame. Snow has the courage of his convictions: though his detective wife urged him to curtail his quest to avoid career risk, his book is provocative. Illus. not seen by PW.

The construction of this winding gravel road--GI's called it the ALCAN--was very much an all-American adventure: blacks, whites, and natives working together under the harshest extremes of climate and terrain--racing to bolster Alaska's defenses and deter another Japanese attack on North American soil.<br>It is a story of ambitious men, such as Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, the Army's suavely ruthless chief logistician, who brooked no opposition to his grandiose schemes. "Dynamite in a Tiffany Box" some called him. It is the story of Master Sergeant Wansley Hill and thousands of other black soldiers who, unwanted by their country for duty on the front lines, nonetheless proved themselves steadfast heroes in the land of the midnight sun. And it is also the story of natives like Charlie McDonald, a guide whose intimate knowledge of the land--with its dense forests, impassable muskeg bogs, and unmapped mountain valleys--was used by the Army Engineers to help build a road that has brought fundamental change to a once-remote corner of the North American continent.<br>The Alaska Highway--with its hundreds of bridges, chain of airfields, and oil refinery and pipeline system (known as CANOL)--opened to traffic in late 1942 and was in full use one year later. Though one of the greatest feats of twentieth-century macro-engineering, this huge project sparked as much protest as patriotism. Critics argued that the road was in the wrong place and would have little postwar value; a well-publicized investigation of CANOL's excesses gave a critical boost to the career of Senator Harry S. Truman.<br>Despite such controversy, the completion of the highway provided a historical watershed for the territory of Alaska, for in the decades that followed, the land would be propelled, often reluctantly, from a pristine refuge, a nineteenth-century land inhabited by natives, dreamers, and rugged individualists, into the twentieth century.<br>In the tradition of David McCullough's The Path Between the Seas, Heath Twichell's Northwest Epic is a sweeping and richly textured history, a book that tells of almost forgotten hardships and heroics during the darkest days of World War II.</p><p>Plodding, statistics-clogged account of the construction of the Alcan Highway, hacked out of the Canadian/Alaskan wilderness by the US military and private contractors during the early, anxiety- filled days of WW II. Twichell is a former West Point history teacher whose father was an Army officer involved with the project. Begun immediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Alcan Highway, Twichell explains, was intended to provide a relatively safe supply line to the then-Territory of Alaska. Four routes were proposed, each supported by local boosters eager to share in the promised economic bonanza. White and black regiments of the US Army Engineers, mostly ill-trained and ill-equipped, were dispatched to the area. Twichell does a fine job of capturing the tensions and rivalries that accompanied the use of these rigorously segregated troops. But when he turns to an almost mile-by-mile, bulldozer-by-bulldozer, mountain-by-mountain account of their progress, his narrative pace falters, only quickening when he incorporates anecdotes into his story--tales of the grizzled guides, the seat-of-their-pants bush pilots, or the black enlisted men who helped build the highway. Also of interest are Twichell's reports on the backbiting common among top brass; a brief discussion of the Senate investigating committee--headed by future President Truman--that blew the whistle on Army excesses; and a look at the delivery of Lend-Lease planes to Russia over the arctic route. Such bright spots, however, are infrequent as the author devotes page after page to catalogues of distances covered, the number of automotive breakdowns, troop allotments, and other ledger-sheet matters. WW II-era historians may benefit from the welter of facts and figures; most readers, though, will find Twichell's account as tedious as a Yukon winter. (Illustrations--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Army in early 1942 began a colossal and controversial undertaking--the feverish construction of a 1500-mile gravel road through largely unmapped and rugged northwest Canada to Fairbanks, Alaska. Overcoming ice, racist attitudes, morale problems and other obstacles, the project was rushed to successful completion in two years at a cost of $500 million. Twichell ( Allen ), spurred by the unpublished memoirs of his father, who, as an Army officer, worked on the road, provides the most comprehensive history of the Alcan yet written. The author's powerful treatment of the project--combining the CANOL oil pipeline and Northwest Staging Route for airplanes in one dazzling road--rages from explorations in the region in 1789 to Sen. Harry Truman's star-rising probe as head of a commission investigating Army projects and Twichell's findings as he follows the route a half century later.

The regulators dramatically pursued and publicly denounced former lieutenants of Al Capone, alleged overlords of the American Mafia, nationally known professional gamblers, and major casino owners, as well as small-time bookies and hoods, reputed sports fixers, and gambling cheats. To date, thirty-eight names have been entered in the Black Book, including Sam Giancana, Anthony Spilotro, and Frank &#x201c;Lefty&#x201d; Rosenthal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farrell and Case contend, however, that the denunciations were a melodrama, meant to show that the government was cleansing the city of corruption. Through the Black Book, the regulators focus public attention on &#x201c;the Mob,&#x201d; rather than on a multitude of competing criminal interests already in the gaming industry.

By examining regulatory hearing records on gaming from 1950 to the present, Farrell and Case reveal unfair targeting of Italian-Americans and others fitting the "mafia" stereotype. The authors explore the cases of two such "excluded persons", Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal and Anthony Spilotro, also the principle characters in the Martin Scorsese film Casino. Farrell and Case maintain that the Black Book is used to make the gaming industry appear clean, that is, free of Mob influence. In fact, they say, corporate crime presents a greater and unacknowledged danger to Nevada's gambling business. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Three Theban Plays: Antigone, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus</h2><p>Towering over the rest of Greek tragedy, these 3 plays are among the most enduring and timeless dramas ever written.

The three plays--&#34;Antigone,&#34; &#34;Oedipus the King,&#34; and &#34;Oedipus at Colonus&#34;--are not strictly a trilogy, but all are based on the Theban myths that were old even in Sophocles&#39; time.

The boys helped their father in the fields, mending fences, bringing the cows back to be milked, digging drills of potatoes; Mary fed the calves, Kathleen baked the bread, and Geraldine did the hens.<br><br>Not that they ever called her Geraldine&#x2014;she was &#x201c;Chicky&#x201d; as far back as anyone could remember. A serious little girl pouring out meal for the baby chickens or collecting the fresh eggs each day, always saying &#x201c;chuck, chuck, chuck&#x201d; soothingly into the feathers as she worked. Chicky had names for all the hens, and no one could tell her when one had been taken to provide a Sunday lunch. They always pretended it was a shop chicken, but Chicky always knew.<br><br>Stoneybridge was a paradise for children during the summer, but summer in the West of Ireland was short, and most of the time it was wet and wild and lonely on the Atlantic coast. Still, there were caves to explore, cliffs to climb, birds&#x2019; nests to discover, and wild sheep with great curly horns to investigate. And then there was Stone House. Chicky loved to play in its huge overgrown garden. Sometimes the Miss Sheedys, three sisters who owned the house and were ancient, let her play at dressing up in their old clothes.<br><br>Chicky watched as Kathleen went off to train to be a nurse in a big hospital in Wales, and then Mary got a job in an insurance office. Neither of those jobs appealed to Chicky at all, but she would have to do something. The land wouldn&#x2019;t support the whole Ryan family. Two of the boys had gone to serve their time in business in big towns in the West. Only Brian would work with his father.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s mother was always tired and her father always worried. They were relieved when Chicky got a job in the knitting factory. Not as a machinist or home knitter but in the office. She was in charge of sending out the finished garments to customers and keeping the books. It wasn&#x2019;t a great job but it did mean that she could stay at home, which was what she wanted. She had plenty of friends around the place, and each summer she fell in love with a different O&#x2019;Hara boy but nothing ever came of it.<br><br>Then one day Walter Starr, a young American, wandered into the knitting factory wanting to buy an Aran sweater. Chicky was instructed to explain to him that the factory was not a retail outlet, they only made up sweaters for stores or mail order.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re missing a trick then,&#x201d; Walter Starr said. &#x201c;People come to this wild place and they need an Aran sweater, and they need it now, not in a few weeks&#x2019; time.&#x201d;<br><br>He was very handsome. He reminded her of how Jack and Bobby Kennedy had looked when they were boys, same flashing smile and good teeth. He was suntanned and very different from the boys around Stoneybridge. She didn&#x2019;t want him to leave the knitting factory and he didn&#x2019;t seem to want to go either.<br><br>Chicky remembered a sweater they had in stock, which they had used to be photographed. Perhaps Walter Starr might like to buy that one&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t exactly new but it was nearly new.<br><br>He said it would be perfect.<br><br>He invited her to go for a walk on the beach, and he told her this was one of the most beautiful places on earth.<br><br>Imagine! He had been to California and Italy and yet he thought Stoneybridge was beautiful.<br><br>And he thought Chicky was beautiful too. He said she was just so cute with her dark curly hair and her big blue eyes. They spent every possible moment together. He had intended to stay only a day or two, but now he found it hard to go on anywhere else. Unless she would come with him, of course.<br><br>Chicky laughed out loud at the idea that she should pack in her job at the knitting factory and tell her mother and father that she was going around Ireland hitchhiking with an American that she had just met! It would have been more acceptable to suggest flying to the moon.<br><br>Walter found her horror at the idea touching and almost endearing.<br><br>&#x201c;We only have one life, Chicky. They can&#x2019;t live it for us. We have to live it ourselves. Do you think my parents want me out here in the wilds of nowhere, having a good time? No, they want me in the country club playing tennis with the daughters of nice families, but, hey, this is where I want to be. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&#x201d;<br><br>Walter Starr lived in a world where everything was simple. They loved each other, so what was more natural than to make love? They each knew the other was right, so why complicate their lives by fretting over what other people would say or think or do? A kindly God understood love. Father Johnson, who had taken a vow never to fall in love, didn&#x2019;t. They didn&#x2019;t need any stupid contracts or certificates, did they?<br><br>And after six glorious weeks, when Walter had to think of going back to the States, Chicky was ready to go with him. It involved an immense amount of rows and dramas and enormous upset in the Ryan household. But Walter was unaware of any of this.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s father was more worried than ever now because everyone would say that he had brought up a tramp who was no better than she should be.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s mother looked more tired and disappointed than ever, and said only God and his sainted mother knew what she had done wrong in bringing Chicky up to be such a scourge to them all.<br><br>Kathleen said that it was just as well she had an engagement ring on her finger because no man would have her if he knew the kind of family she came from.<br><br>Mary, who worked in the insurance office and was walking out with one of the O&#x2019;Haras, said that the days of her romance were now numbered, thanks to Chicky. The O&#x2019;Haras were a very respectable family in the town, and they wouldn&#x2019;t think kindly about this behavior at all.<br><br>Her brother Brian kept his head down and said nothing at all. When Chicky asked him what he thought, Brian said he didn&#x2019;t think. He didn&#x2019;t have time to think.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;Peggy, who also worked in the knitting factory, and Nuala, who was a maid for the three Miss Sheedys&#x2014;said it was the most exciting, reckless thing they had ever heard of, and wasn&#x2019;t it great that she had a passport already from that school trip to Lourdes.<br><br>Walter Starr said they would stay in New York with friends of his. He was going to drop out of law school&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t really right for him. If we had several lives, well then, yes, maybe, but since we only have one life it wasn&#x2019;t worth spending it studying law.<br><br>The night before she left, Chicky tried to make her parents understand her feelings She was twenty, she had her whole life to live, she wanted to love her family and for them to love her in spite of their disappointment.<br><br>Her father&#x2019;s face was tight and hard. She would never be welcome in this house again, she had brought shame on them all.<br><br>Her mother was bitter. She said that Chicky was being very, very foolish. It wouldn&#x2019;t last, it couldn&#x2019;t last. It was not love, it was infatuation. If this Walter really loved her, then he would wait for her and provide her with a home and his name and a future instead of all this nonsense.<br><br>You could cut the atmosphere in the Ryan household with a knife.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s sisters were no support. But she was adamant. They hadn&#x2019;t known real love. She was not going to change her plans. She had her passport. She was going to go to America.<br><br>&#x201c;Wish me well,&#x201d; she had begged them the night before she left, but they had turned their faces away.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let me go away with the memory of you being so cold.&#x201d; Chicky had tears running down her face.<br><br>Her mother sighed a great sigh. &#x201c;It would be cold if we just said, &#x2018;Go ahead, enjoy yourself.&#x2019; We are trying to do our best for you. To help you make the best of your life. This is not love, it&#x2019;s only some sort of infatuation. There&#x2019;s no use pretending. You can&#x2019;t have our blessing. It&#x2019;s just not there for you.&#x201d;<br><br>So Chicky left without it.<br><br>At Shannon Airport there were crowds waving good-bye to their children setting out for a new life in the United States. There was nobody to wave Chicky good-bye, but she and Walter didn&#x2019;t care. They had their whole life ahead of them.<br><br>No rules, no doing the right thing to please the neighbors and relations.<br><br>They would be free&#x2014;free to work where they wanted and at what they wanted.<br><br>No trying to fulfill other people&#x2019;s hopes&#x2014;to marry a rich farmer, in Chicky&#x2019;s case, or to become a top lawyer, which was what Walter&#x2019;s family had in mind for him.<br><br>Walter&#x2019;s friends were welcoming in the big apartment in Brooklyn. Young people, friendly and easygoing. Some worked in bookshops, some in bars. Others were musicians. They came and went easily. Nobody made any fuss. It was so very different from home. A couple came in from the Coast, and a girl from Chicago who wrote poetry. There was a Mexican boy who played the guitar in Latino bars.<br><br>Everyone was so relaxed. Chicky found it amazing. Nobody made any demands. They would make a big chili for supper with everyone helping. There was no pressure.<br><br>They sighed a bit about their families not understanding anything, but it didn&#x2019;t weigh heavily on anyone. Soon Chicky felt Stoneybridge fade away a little. However, she wrote a letter home every week. She had decided from the outset that she would not be the one to keep a feud going.<br><br>If one side behaved normally, then sooner or later the other side would have to respond and behave normally as well.<br><br>She did hear from some of her friends, and had the odd bit of news from them. Peggy and Nuala wrote and told her about life back home; it didn&#x2019;t seem to have changed much in any way at all. So she was able to write to say she was delighted about the plans for Kathleen&#x2019;s wedding to Mikey, and did not mention that she had heard about Mary&#x2019;s romance with Sonny O&#x2019;Hara having ended.<br><br>Her mother wrote brisk little cards, asking whether she had fixed a date for her wedding yet and wondering about whether there were Irish priests in the parish.<br><br>She told them nothing about the communal life she lived in the big crowded apartment, with all the coming and going and guitar playing. They would never have been able to begin to understand.<br><br>Instead, she wrote about going to art-exhibit openings and theater first nights. She read about these in the papers, and sometimes indeed she and Walter went to matinees or got cheap seats at previews through friends of friends who wanted to fill a house.<br><br>Walter had a job helping to catalog a library for some old friends of his parents. His family had hoped to woo him back this way to some form of academic life, he said, and it wasn&#x2019;t a bad job. They left him alone and didn&#x2019;t give him any hassle. That&#x2019;s all anyone wanted in life.<br><br>Chicky learned that this was definitely all Walter wanted in life. So she didn&#x2019;t nag him about when she would meet his parents, or when they would find a place of their own, or indeed what they would do down the line. They were together in New York. That was enough, wasn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>And in many ways it was.<br><br>Chicky got herself a job in a diner. The hours suited her. She could get up very early, leave the apartment before anyone else was awake. She helped open up the diner, did her shift and served breakfasts. She was back at the apartment before the others had struggled into the day, bringing them cold milk and bagels left over from the diner&#x2019;s breakfast stock. They got used to her bringing them their supplies. She still heard news from home but it became more and more remote.</p><h2>Green Grass of Wyoming</h2><p>No longer an adolescent, Ken McLaughlin falls in love with a girl who shares his passionate affection for horses</p><p></p><h2>Corum : Knight of the Swords&#39;, &#39;Queen of the Swords&#39;, &#39;King of the Swords</h2><p>Three novels- The Knight of the Swords, The Queen of the Swords, The King of the Swords- from Michael Moorcock&#39;s classic fantasy sequence.</p><p>Born in London in 1939, Michael Moorcock now lives in Texas.

It is the work of one of the world's most distinguished writers.<br><br>Tony Webster and his clique first met Adrian Finn at school.

This last isn&#x2019;t something I actually saw, but what you end up remembering isn&#x2019;t always the same as what you have witnessed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We live in time &#x2013; it holds us and moulds us &#x2013; but I&#x2019;ve never felt I understood it very well. And I&#x2019;m not referring to theories about how it bends and doubles back, or may exist elsewhere in parallel versions. No, I mean ordinary, everyday time, which clocks and watches assure us passes regularly: tick-tock, click-clock. Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time&#x2019;s malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missing &#x2013; until the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return.&nbsp;<br><br>* * *&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m not very interested in my schooldays, and don&#x2019;t feel any nostalgia for them. But school is where it all began, so I need to return briefly to a few incidents that have grown into anecdotes, to some approximate memories which time has deformed into certainty. If I can&#x2019;t be sure of the actual events any more, I can at least be true to the impressions those facts left. That&#x2019;s the best I can manage.&nbsp;<br><br>There were three of us, and he now made the fourth. We hadn&#x2019;t expected to add to our tight number: cliques and pairings had happened long before, and we were already beginning to imagine our escape from school into life. His name was Adrian Finn, a tall, shy boy who initially kept his eyes down and his mind to himself. For the first day or two, we took little notice of him: at our school there was no welcoming ceremony, let alone its opposite, the punitive induction. We just registered his presence and waited.&nbsp;<br><br>The masters were more interested in him than we were. They had to work out his intelligence and sense of discipline, calculate how well he&#x2019;d previously been taught, and if he might prove &#x2018;scholarship material&#x2019;. On the third morning of that autumn term, we had a history class with Old Joe Hunt, wryly affable in his three-piece suit, a teacher whose system of control depended on maintaining sufficient but not excessive boredom.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Now, you&#x2019;ll remember that I asked you to do some preliminary reading about the reign of Henry VIII.&#x2019; Colin, Alex and I squinted at one another, hoping that the ques�tion wouldn&#x2019;t be flicked, like an angler&#x2019;s fly, to land on one of our heads. &#x2018;Who might like to offer a characterisation of the age?&#x2019; He drew his own conclusion from our averted eyes. &#x2018;Well, Marshall, perhaps. How would you describe Henry VIII&#x2019;s reign?&#x201d;<br><br>Our relief was greater than our curiosity, because Marshall was a cautious know-nothing who lacked the inventiveness of true ignorance. He searched for possible hidden complexities in the question before eventually locating a response.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;There was unrest, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>An outbreak of barely controlled smirking; Hunt himself almost smiled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Would you, perhaps, care to elaborate?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Marshall nodded slow assent, thought a little longer, and decided it was no time for caution. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d say there was great unrest, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Finn, then. Are you up in this period?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>The new boy was sitting a row ahead and to my left. He had shown no evident reaction to Marshall&#x2019;s idiocies.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Not really, sir, I&#x2019;m afraid. But there is one line of thought according to which all you can truly say of any historical event &#x2013; even the outbreak of the First World War, for example &#x2013; is that &#x201c;something happened&#x201d;.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Is there, indeed? Well, that would put me out of a job, wouldn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; After some sycophantic laughter, Old Joe Hunt pardoned our holiday idleness and filled us in on the polygamous royal butcher.&nbsp;<br><br>At the next break, I sought out Finn.&#x2018;I&#x2019;m Tony Webster.&#x2019; He looked at me warily. &#x2018;Great line to Hunt.&#x2019; He seemed not to know what I was referring to. &#x2018;About something happening.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh. Yes. I was rather disappointed he didn&#x2019;t take it up.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t what he was supposed to say.&nbsp;<br><br>Another detail I remember: the three of us, as a symbol of our bond, used to wear our watches with the face on the inside of the wrist. It was an affectation, of course, but perhaps something more. It made time feel like a personal, even a secret, thing.We expected Adrian to note the gesture, and follow suit; but he didn&#x2019;t.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Later that day &#x2013; or perhaps another day &#x2013; we had a double English period with Phil Dixon, a young master just down from Cambridge. He liked to use contemporary texts, and would throw out sudden challenges.&#x2018;&#x201c;Birth, and Copulation, and Death&#x201d; &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what T. S. Eliot says it&#x2019;s all about. Any comments?&#x2019; He once compared a Shakespearean hero to Kirk Douglas in&nbsp;<i>Spartacus</i>. And I remember how, when we were discussing Ted Hughes&#x2019;s poetry, he put his head at a donnish slant and murmured,&#x2018;Of course, we&#x2019;re all wondering what will happen when he runs out of animals.&#x2019; Sometimes, he addressed us as &#x2018;Gentlemen&#x2019;. Naturally, we adored him.&nbsp;<br><br>That afternoon, he handed out a poem with no title, date or author&#x2019;s name, gave us ten minutes to study it, then asked for our responses.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Shall we start with you, Finn? Put simply, what would you say this poem is&nbsp;<i>about</i>?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Adrian looked up from his desk. &#x2018;Eros and Thanatos, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Hmm. Go on.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Sex and death,&#x2019; Finn continued, as if it might not just be the thickies in the back row who didn&#x2019;t understand Greek. &#x2018;Or love and death, if you prefer.The erotic principle, in any case, coming into conflict with the death principle. And what ensues from that conflict. Sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>I was probably looking more impressed than Dixon thought healthy.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Webster, enlighten us further.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I just thought it was a poem about a barn owl, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>This was one of the differences between the three of us and our new friend. We were essentially taking the piss, except when we were serious. He was essentially serious, except when he was taking the piss. It took us a while to work this out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Adrian allowed himself to be absorbed into our group, without acknowledging that it was something he sought. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t. Nor did he alter his views to accord with ours. At morning prayers he could be heard joining in the responses while Alex and I merely mimed the words, and Colin preferred the satirical ploy of the pseudo-zealot&#x2019;s enthusiastic bellow.The three of us considered school sports a crypto-fascist plan for repressing our sex-drive; Adrian joined the fencing club and did the high jump. We were belligerently tone-deaf; he came to school with his clarinet. When Colin denounced the family, I mocked the political system, and Alex made philosophical objections to the perceived nature of reality, Adrian kept his counsel &#x2013; at first, anyway. He gave the impression that he believed in things. We did too &#x2013; it was just that we wanted to believe in our own things, rather than what had been decided for us. Hence what we thought of as our cleansing scepticism.&nbsp;<br><br>The school was in central London, and each day we travelled up to it from our separate boroughs, passing from one system of control to another. Back then, things were plainer: less money, no electronic devices, little fashion tyranny, no girlfriends. There was nothing to distract us from our human and filial duty which was to study, pass exams, use those qualifications to find a job, and then put together a way of life unthreateningly fuller than that of our parents, who would approve, while privately comparing it to their own earlier lives, which had been simpler, and therefore superior. None of this, of course, was ever stated: the genteel social Darwinism of the English middle classes always remained implicit.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Fucking bastards, parents,&#x2019; Colin complained one Monday lunchtime. &#x2018;You think they&#x2019;re OK when you&#x2019;re little, then you realise they&#x2019;re just like . . .&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Henry VIII, Col?&#x2019; Adrian suggested.We were beginning to get used to his sense of irony; also to the fact that it might be turned against us as well.When teasing, or calling us to seriousness, he would address me as Anthony; Alex would become Alexander, and the unlengthenable Colin shortened to Col.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t mind if my dad had half a dozen wives.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And was incredibly rich.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And painted by Holbein.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And told the Pope to sod off.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Any particular reason why they&#x2019;re FBs?&#x2019; Alex asked Colin.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I wanted us to go to the funfair. They said they had to spend the weekedn gardening.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term &#x2018;single�parent family&#x2019; came into use; back then it was &#x2018;a broken home&#x2019;, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn&#x2019;t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family &#x2013; or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In those days, we imagined ourselves as being kept in some kind of holding pen, waiting to he released into our lives. And when that moment came, our lives &#x2013; and time itself &#x2013; would speed up. How were we to know that our lives had in any case begun, that some advantage had already been gained, some damage already inflicted? Also, that our release would only be into a larger holding pen, whose boundaries would be at first undiscernible.&nbsp;<br><br>In the meantime, we were book-hungry, sex-hungry, meritocratic, anarchistic. All political and social systems appeared to us corrupt, yet we declined to consider an alternative other than hedonistic chaos. Adrian, however, pushed us to believe in the application of thought to life, in the notion that principles should guide actions. Previously, Alex had been regarded as the philosopher among us. He had read stuff the other two hadn&#x2019;t, and might, for instance, suddenly declare, &#x2018;Whereof we cannot speak, thereof must we remain silent.&#x2019; Colin and I would consider this idea in silence for a while, then grin and carry on talking. But now Adrian&#x2019;s arrival dislodged Alex from his position &#x2013; or rather, gave us another choice of philosopher. If Alex had read Russell and Wittgenstein, Adrian had read Camus and Nietzsche. I had read George Orwell and Aldous Huxley; Colin had read Baudelaire and Dostoevsky. This is only a slight caricature.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, of course we were pretentious &#x2013; what else is youth for? We used terms like &#x2018;<i>Weltanschauung</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>Sturm und Drang</i>&#x2019;, enjoyed saying &#x2018;That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident&#x2019;, and assured one another that the imagination&#x2019;s first duty was to be transgressive. Our parents saw things differently, picturing their children as innocents suddenly exposed to noxious influence. So Colin&#x2019;s mother referred to me as his &#x2018;dark angel&#x2019;; my father blamed Alex when he found me reading&nbsp;<i>The Communist Manifesto</i>; Colin was fingered by Alex&#x2019;s parents when they caught him with a hard-boiled American crime novel. And so on. It was the same with sex. Our parents thought we might be corrupted by one another into becoming whatever it was they most feared: an incorrigible masturbator, a winsome homosexual, a recklessly impregnatory libertine. On our behalf they dreaded the closeness of adolescent friendship, the predatory behaviour of strangers on trains, the lure of the wrong kind of girl. How far their anxieties outran our experience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>One afternoon Old Joe Hunt, as if picking up Adrian&#x2019;s earlier challenge, asked us to debate the origins of the First World War: specifically, the responsibility of Archduke Franz Ferdinand&#x2019;s assassin for starting the whole thing off. Back then, we were most of us absolutists. We liked Yes v No, Praise v Blame, Guilt v Innocence &#x2013; or, in Marshall&#x2019;s case, Unrest v Great Unrest. We liked a game that ended in a win and loss, not a draw. And so for some, the Serbian gunman, whose name is long gone from my memory, had one hundred per cent individual responsibility: take him out of the equation, and the war would never have happened. Others preferred the one hundred per cent responsibility of historical forces, which had placed the antagonistic nations on an inevitable collision course: &#x2018;Europe was a powder keg waiting to blow&#x2019;, and so on. The more anarchic, like Colin, argued that everything was down to chance, that the world existed in a state of perpetual chaos, and only some primitive storytelling instinct, itself doubtless a hangover from religion, retrospectively imposed meaning on what might or might not have happened.&nbsp;<br><br>Hunt gave a brief nod to Colin&#x2019;s attempt to undermine everything, as if morbid disbelief was a natural by-product of adolescence, something to be grown out of. Masters and parents used to remind us irritatingly that they too had once been young, and so could speak with authority. It&#x2019;s just a phase, they would insist. You&#x2019;ll grow out of it; life will teach you reality and realism. But back then we declined to acknowledge that they had ever been anything like us, and we knew that we grasped life &#x2013; and truth, and morality, and art &#x2013; far more clearly than our compromised elders.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Finn, you&#x2019;ve been quiet. You started this ball rolling. You are, as it were our Serbian gunman.&#x2019; Hunt paused to let the allusion take effect. &#x2018;Would you care to give us the benefit of your thoughts?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;What don&#x2019;t you know?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, in one sense. I can&#x2019;t know what it is that I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident.&#x2019; He left one of those slight pauses in which we again wondered if he was engaged in subtle mockery or a high seriousness beyond the rest of us.&#x2018;Indeed, isn&#x2019;t the whole business of ascribing responsibility a kind of cop-out? We want to blame an individual so that everyone else is exculpated. Or we blame a historical process as a way of exonerating individuals. Or it&#x2019;s all anarchic chaos, with the same consequence. It seems to me that there is &#x2013; was &#x2013; a chain of individual respon�sibilities, all of which were necessary, but not so long a chain that everybody can simply blame everyone else. But of course, my desire to ascribe responsibility might be more a reflection of my own cast of mind than a fair analysis of what happ...</p><h2>Briar&#39;s Book (Circle Of Magic)</h2><p>As a strange plague settles over the land and threatens their very existence, Briar, Daja, Sandry, and Tris must use their magic to find the source of the sickness...fast.</p><p>BOOK FOUR IN THE CIRCLE OF MAGIC QUARTET<p>Former "street rat" Briar leads a comfortable life at Winding Circle Temple, learning plant magic from Rosethorn.

He was, said Christian Dior,"the master of us all." </p><p>But despite his extraordinary impact, Balenciaga was a man hidden from view. Unlike today's celebrity designers, he saw to it that little was known about him, to the point that some French journalists wondered if he existed at all. Even his most notable and devoted clients&#x2015;Marlene Dietrich, Barbara Hutton, a clutch of Rothschilds&#x2015;never met him. </p><p>But one woman knew Balenciaga very well indeed. The first person he hired when he opened his Paris house (then furnished with only a table and a stool) was Florette Chelot, who became his top vendeuse&#x2015;as much an adviser as a saleswoman. She witnessed the spectacular success of his first collection, and they worked closely for more than thirty years, until 1968, when Balenciaga abruptly closed his house without telling any of his staff. Youth-oriented fashion was taking over, Paris was in upheaval, and the elder statesman wanted no part of it. </p><p>In <i>The Master of Us All </i>, Mary Blume tells the remarkable story of the man and his house through the eyes of the woman who knew him best. Intimate and revealing, this is an unprecedented portrait of a designer whose vision transformed an industry but whose story has never been told until now.</p></p><p><p>Mary Blume, a native New Yorker who lives in Paris, was a longtime columnist for the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>. She is the author of <i>C�te d'Azur: Inventing the</i> <i>French Riviera </i>and of a collection of her <i>Herald</i> <i>Tribune </i>pieces, <i>A French Affair.</i></p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Crist�bal Balenciaga: a beautiful name. <i>Elle</i> magazine rhapsodized in 1950 that the four syllables of &#x201c;Balenciaga&#x201d; simply burst forth upon the page (actually, there are five), while a contemporary poet sees in the name&#x2019;s &#x201c;swaying melody the flowing quality of Balenciaga&#x2019;s clothes and exquisite <i>justesse</i> of their proportions.&#x201d; It is a once-upon-a-time sort of name that should be part of a fable, and it is. <br>The setting is the humble fishing village of Getaria on Spain&#x2019;s Basque coast, between San Sebasti�n and Bilbao, the date early in the last century. The fairy tale has many versions, but let Pauline de Rothschild, the former Pauline Potter, begin: <br>In the center of a street made dark by the shadows of its thick stone houses, a woman was walking, her back turned to the light from the sea. She wore a pale, ankle length, silk shantung suit. The severe houses enclosed her, shuttered. <br>A boy was watching her. <br>She would come almost abreast of him, and he would run up a side-street of the fishing village, so closely carved into the mountain that its streets are as steep and narrow as Genoa&#x2019;s, some entirely made of steps. Down another he would run and be ahead of her again. <br>Then he would stare. <br>One day he stopped her, and asked if he could make a suit for her. The boy was about thirteen, with dark hair and darker eyes and the smile he would keep all his life. <br>&#x201c;Why do you want to do this?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Because I think I can,&#x201d; he answered. <br>The boy was Crist�bal Balenciaga&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>The woman was the old Marquesa de Casa Torres (or her daughter-in-law) and she was wearing a white (or beige) Worth, Drecoll, Ceruit, or Redfern dress or suit, according to who is telling the tale. She was possibly on her way to (or from) Mass. The boy may have been as young as six (or as old as nineteen), and his father&#x2014;who had died of a heart attack or was drowned at sea&#x2014;was either a fisherman or the captain of the royal yacht. Cheeky young Crist�bal, the legend continues, copied her outfit so perfectly that the marquesa became his patron and took him while he was still in his teens to meet the great couturier Jacques Doucet in Paris. <br>Some of this is true. <br>But much of it isn&#x2019;t. The very plainness of plain fact has never seemed to fit someone so exotic as Balenciaga (as if the amazing could not spring from the quotidian), and so for decades the legends were embellished rather than investigated. Then a young Basque curator named Miren Arzalluz took the trouble to dig into official records and in 2010 published her findings about Balenciaga&#x2019;s family and early years. Myths, uncovered facts, and one&#x2019;s own instinct about the mix can finally make a coherent, if spare, whole. <br>Getaria, Balenciaga&#x2019;s birthplace, is a modest and handsome fishing village whose past as a whaling port brought it sufficient wealth to have as its center an oversize Gothic church, San Salvador, of surpassing gloom and considerable weirdness because its near-trapezoidal floor tilts noticeably up toward the altar. A statue near the city hall honors the local hero, Sebasti�n de Elcano, the first captain to circumnavigate the globe (as Magellan&#x2019;s second in command he took over when Magellan was killed in the Philippines), and new plaques mark the birthplaces of Balenciaga, in a tidy small house near the church, and the mother of Pl�cido Domingo, over an anchovy cannery. Getaria has excellent fish that restaurateurs grill in the street, and gray buildings whose sound proportions and straightness of line are bolder than the often-quaint Basque architecture of France. Even now Getaria has an air of provincial rectitude; its inhabitants provided San Sebasti�n, thirty kilometers along the coast, with fish and services when the Spanish king and his court went there each summer. <br>In about 1853, France&#x2019;s Empress Eug�nie, who was born in Spain, invented Biarritz as a fashionable resort. Following her example, in 1887, Queen Mar�a Cristina of Spain decided to make San Sebasti�n, across the border, the official summer home of the Spanish court. While Biarritz is dramatic and citified, San Sebasti�n is calmer and more elegant, with a wide seafront and restaurants that have made it a foodie mecca today. Friends in Paris were often surprised by the supposedly austere Balenciaga&#x2019;s pleasure in good eating, but he was Basque, and three existential questions, it is said, trouble the Basques each day: Where do we come from? Who are we? What are we going to have for dinner? <br>The last question results in excellent local cooking; the first two are harder. No one knows where the Basques come from&#x2014;even the prevalent blood type differs from that of other Europeans&#x2014;and they like to think of themselves as Europe&#x2019;s aborigines, their spiritual locus being an ancient oak tree in Guernica. The Basques&#x2019; language, Euskera, once believed to be the tongue spoken in the Garden of Eden, bears no relation to any other, and they group all the other languages in the world in one single dismissive word, Erdera. They are proud (by an ancient royal Spanish edict they are all aristocrats), deeply Catholic, and intractable. Crist�bal Balenciaga was definitely Basque. <br>The family was modest but respected: his father, a fisherman, served briefly as mayor of Getaria and rose to skipper the launch that was often used by the Spanish court, including the queen, in the summer season. His mother bore five children, two of whom died in infancy. Crist�bal, born in 1895, was the youngest; his sister, Agustina, and his brother, Juan Mart�n, remained his business associates in Spain throughout their lives. The older children were already at work when their father died after a stroke, leaving eleven-year-old Crist�bal alone to help out his mother, Martina Eizaguirre. <br>Well before her husband&#x2019;s death Martina was already giving sewing lessons to local girls and making dresses for private clients such as the Marquesa de Casa Torres, whose dressmaker she became a year before before Crist�bal was born. Hubert de Givenchy says that Balenciaga told him that his first attempt at design was to make a necklace for his cat (&#x201c;but since you can&#x2019;t make a cat lie on its back all the beads scattered&#x201d;), while a French magazine claims that he began by making a coat, including the legs, for his dog (presumably an early manifestation of his passion for sleeves). In any event the boy was at home with his mother, helping out, playing with scraps of fabric, and often going with her for fittings in the homes of summering aristocrats. <br>So the long-accepted legend of the meeting between the marquesa and the boy must be replaced by more convincing fact: he knew the marquesa and her home, just up the hill from the center of Getaria, from childhood. While he was helping his mother or playing with the marquesa&#x2019;s children, he took in her wardrobe and her fashion magazines and her well-chosen furnishings (the marqu�s owned paintings by Goya and Vel�squez), plugging naturally into the world of high style where he would spend his life. Not only could he study the Paris gowns his mother copied for summer use, but he could also learn to appreciate English tailoring and take in such novelties as department stores and buying by catalog, both of which the marquesa enjoyed. <br>Although he was never at ease with the French <i>gratin</i>, or upper crust, from her he picked up a comfortable familiarity with the Spanish aristocracy: it was of course Balenciaga who made the wedding dress of the marquesa&#x2019;s great-grandaughter, Fabiola, when she married the king of the Belgians in 1960, and a few years later one of his models was astonished to see, on the salon&#x2019;s white sofa, the taciturn Balenciaga laughing and chatting away with an elderly lady who turned out to be Victoria Eugenia, the former queen of Spain. <br>Through the marquesa, the twelve-year-old Balenciaga apprenticed with a San Sebasti�n tailor, then moved on to a tonier shop called New England, and to the new San Sebasti�n branch of the Grand Magasins du Louvre department store, which was patronized not only by the marquesa but by Mar�a Cristina, the dowager queen. By 1913 he was being sent to Paris as a buyer. After a short spell in Bordeaux to learn French, in 1918 he opened his first salon, C. Balenciaga, in San Sebasti�n, then went into a six-year partnership with two sisters who provided most of the backing. Balenciaga&#x2019;s investment was 7,362 pesetas and 25 c�ntimos, the 25 cents recalling that if his reputation was growing, his finances were still tight. When the six-year contract ended in 1924, he was able to open a new house, Crist�bal Balenciaga, gradually creating branches in Madrid and Barcelona under his name or under variations of Eisa, a reworking of his mother&#x2019;s maiden name. <br>The timing was just right. While most of Europe agonized in World War I, Spain, which remained neutral, flourished, especially San Sebasti�n, enriched by the wealth of Bilbao, a port and a banking and industrial center, and by the well-heeled of all nations who came to bask in its elegance and ease. Old-timers such as the duchess, who went to Paris each year to order 365 hats (366 in leap year), would disappear after the war, but the new crowd was avid and deeply attractive to Paris couturiers who, starting in l917, arrived with their collections. The major houses of Callot, Paquin, and Worth showed in such luxury hotels as the Maria Cristina, and Balenciaga saw, and possibly met, Chanel at San Sebasti�n&#x2019;s casino. Most important, he began a lifelong friendship with Madeleine Vionnet, the first designer to use the bias cut on the body of a dress, fashion&#x2019;s equivalent of inventing the wheel. <br>Balenciaga probably met Vionnet when she showed her collection to the Spanish court at San Sebasti�n in 1920. He was already buying her clothes for his shop on his Paris trips (a hasty working sketch on a piece of hotel stationery in the Arts D�coratifs archive in Paris also suggests that he was not above pinching her ideas), but when they met and she saw his work she encouraged him to create rather than adapt other people&#x2019;s designs. They shared a stubborn and exalted view of clothes as a sort of second skin that sculpts, rather than encases, the body: the couturier as a builder, not a decorator. They were both brilliant technicians, Balenciaga the more versatile in that he was as expert at tailoring coats and suits as at cutting soft fabrics, and both saw the designer as a craftsman dealing with clients and not as a remote artist. &#x201c;A couturier dresses human beings, not dreams,&#x201d; Vionnet would say. Their friendship lasted until Balenciaga&#x2019;s death, and when I met Vionnet in the late 1960s she was just back from a two-week stay in Balenciaga&#x2019;s country house near Orl�ans to recover from bronchitis and was wearing a floor-length bias-cut wool crepe skirt and matching vest that he had made for her in bright red (her own palette tended to shades of beige). <br>They were of equal historical importance&#x2014;if Dior later called Balenciaga &#x201c;the master of us all,&#x201d; he also said &#x201c;no one has carried the art of dressmaking farther than Vionnet&#x201d;&#x2014;but she was a generation older, having been born in 1876, and was already approaching glory when they met. Their clothes were dissimilar, Vionnet specializing in richly simple Greek-style folds, a deliciously errant vestal look, but they shared ardor and integrity&#x2014;&#x201c;a dress must be sincere,&#x201d; Vionnet said&#x2014;and had so intense an understanding of fabrics that neither of them liked to sketch. &#x201c;I hate sketching. Designers who sketch have no feeling for fabric,&#x201d; Vionnet said. Instead, she draped her fabrics on a wooden doll 31.5 inches tall, and Givenchy told me that when she was very old and bedridden and Balenciaga came to visit, she would show him something she had just confected on the doll with the wish that it might be useful to him. &#x201c;And Crist�bal, with that marvelous smile, would say to me, Isn&#x2019;t it adorable that at her age this woman would continue to work and give me her models,&#x201d; Givenchy said. &#x201c;He had until the end of his life someone who counted enormously for him, and that was Madame Vionnet.&#x201d; <br>To the young Balenciaga, Vionnet must have seemed like a favorite teacher, firm but kind, and indeed she had hoped to teach, but a neighbor pointed out to her father (her mother had run off) that further studies would mean more clothing bills, so at the age of ten she was yanked out of school and apprenticed to a dressmaker. &#x201c;If I had become a professor I would just have had a brain,&#x201d; she said many years later. &#x201c;Instead I discovered my hands and learned to love them.&#x201d; In England to pick up the language, she became an attendant in a lunatic asylum, then worked for five years in Kate Reilly&#x2019;s dressmaking establishment on Dover Street in London. Returning to Paris, she was engaged by the prestigious Callot Soeurs, then hired away by Jacques Doucet, a very grand designer and collector (he was an early patron of the furniture designer Eileen Gray and the first owner of <i>Les Demoiselles d&#x2019;Avignon</i>), in order to modernize his house. It was there that she discovered that the bias cut, a version of which had been used only to line garments, could give fabrics a new fluidity: &#x201c;I wanted it and found it,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;It seemed natural.&#x201d; The vendeuses, she added, hated it. In 1912 she opened her own modest house on the Rue de Rivoli and in 1923 got backing to become the first couturier on the Avenue Montaigne. <br>The House of Vionnet, at number 50, towered over its neighbors and triumphed in the architectural press as a perfect example of steel and glass Art Deco. It had 1,900 employees and 43 ateliers. While the grand salon of a house like Callot was heavy and crowded with furniture, Vionnet had a vast clean space framed with arches bordered in Lalique glass. When it came to opening his Paris house, Balenciaga followed Vionnet in keeping his public rooms simple and his private studio strictly off-limits. He did not follow Vionnet&#x2019;s more compassionate innovations&#x2014;a free staff cafeteria, medical service, and child care as well as classes for those who, like her, had had to leave school too young. Since he shared her loathing for copyists, having himself been one on a modest scale, he adopted her practice of photographing each model with its number, flat police lineup pictures, though he did not, like Vionnet, put his thumbprint on the label of every dress he made. <br>Vionnet was stronger and more authoritative than the young Balenciaga&#x2014;he would not have said &#x201c;I have never seen a fabric that refused to obey me,&#x201d; even though it was true&#x2014;and it was her strength and encouragement that helped him free his fantasy and develop his prodigious technique. <br>Discovering his talents, the young Balenciaga had great success&#x2014;by the age of twenty-one he is said to have dressed the queen of Spain&#x2014;and success brought a confidence he lost in his later days when his sole, and impossible, rival was his glorious self. After each new collection in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, people recalled, he would be tearful and tense because it hadn&#x2019;t been up to his standard. In all, it was a dog&#x2019;s life, he said after his retirement. But when he was young and imperfect, all he had to do was get better, and he did. <br>And he found love. Probably on a buying trip to Paris he met a charming and well-connected young man with sleek dark hair, Wladzio Jaworowski d&#x2019;Attainville, with whom he would live for some twenty years. D&#x2019;Attainville was Polish-French; his mother, according to a story in American <i>Vogue</i> in the 1940s, entertained in style and was photographed grandly under a portr...</p><h2>Mastering Layout: On the Art of Eye Appeal</h2><p>This best-selling book by sign industry legend, Mike Stevens, covers the fundamental principles of layout for signs.

The one and only authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, the creative force behind the classic and increasingly popular science fiction show. 16-page insert.</p><p>This readable biography sketches the trajectory of a man whose life might have served as the plot for one of his television dramas. The creator of Star Trek flew missions as a B-17 pilot during WW II, wrote speeches for LA's chief of police, and penned scripts for shows like Dragnet during television's Golden Age. Alexander succeeds in recreating Roddenberry's voice: As the official biographer chosen by Roddenberry, he provides correspondence written over the years to family, friends, and fans. But the author only shifts to warp speed when he discusses how Roddenberry launched the original Star Trek. The book lets Trekkers gorge themselves on the trivia of this cultural phenomenon and overhear backstage bickering. Production memos teem with such revelatory details as actors' contracts (Nimoy originally earned a fourth of Shatner's salary), casting decisions, and of course, the secret campaigns to save Star Trek (all of which Roddenberry inaugurated). Although Rodenberry's widow, Majel Barrett Roddenberry, states in the introduction that her husband wanted to be depicted ``warts and all,'' Alexander remains a friend throughout. Interviews with cast members are curiously absent and would have added depth to such incidents as the series'--and television's--first interracial kiss. According to Alexander, this met with only a single memo of protest from NBC; however, others have attested that network suits refused to let the scene be shot as originally written. To be fair, or provocative, Roddenberry's bouts of drinking, use of amphetamines, and frequent infidelities are recounted. The chance to create another Trek TV series, however, stirred him. While his bitter fights with veteran staffers marred the production, Star Trek: The Next Generation ran for seven years and remained true to its creator's optimistic belief in humanity. While this account swings too far between elegy and gossip, it successfully conveys the spirit of Roddenberry, who led us ``where no one has gone before.''

All rights reserved.</i>Alexander was editor of the Humanist when Roddenberry (1921-1991) chose him as his biographer. The result is a panegyric in the sharpest possible contrast to Joel Engel's Gene Roddenberry (Nonfiction Forecasts, Mar. 21). In tracing his subject's career in the Army Air Corps in WW II, as a Pan Am pilot and member of the Los Angeles Police Department, the author shows Roddenberry as a brave and adventurous man who proved to be hardworking and tenacious as well. While the original Star Trek series lasted for three years and lost money every year until 1969, when it was cancelled, by 1972 it was a huge hit in syndication. Then followed a series of movies starting in 1979 and another TV series, Star Trek: The Next Generation , beginning in 1987, followed by Star Trek: Deep Space Nine . As for "warts," Alexander treats Roddenberry's compulsive womanizing as a lovable idiosyncrasy; he also presents without details a list of six science fiction writers who worked for Roddenberry on Star Trek but would no longer do so.

As his mother stands frozen, a stranger takes a breath and leaps. This is just the beginning of a spellbinding story of passion, heartbreak, and destiny&#x2014;an unforgettable novel about mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, and the extraordinary ways that life and love intersect.</p></p><p><b>Louise Candlish</b> is the author of&nbsp;eight novels including<i> The Double Life of Anna Day</i>, <i>I'll Be There For You</i>, and <i>Since I Don't Have You</i>.Joanna Walsh, winner of a weekend trip to France, is eager to show her daughter, Holly, and her two-year-old grandson, Mikey, the many sights and sounds of Paris. When Mikey falls into the swirling waters of the Seine, Joanna and Holly know their lives have been forever altered. Luckily, Mikey is rescued by a fast-thinking, strong-swimming fellow passenger, but Mikey&#x2019;s accident still sets the wheels of fate in motion. Joanna, a sympathetic heroine attempting to handle her daughter&#x2019;s postpartum depression while caring for Mikey and holding down a job, is the heart and soul of the novel. In this tale of second chances, shifting priorities, undeniable connections, and the power of fate, Candlish has crafted a tender, heartfelt story. Candlish&#x2019;s ability to crack open the heart of a marriage will pique the interest of Marian Keyes fans, while her honest depiction of Holly&#x2019;s postpartum depression is especially admirable. An insightful and driving novel, The Day You Saved My Life explores how far the bonds between husband and wife, mother and child, and victim and savior can bend before they&#x2019;re severed. --Stephanie Turza</p><h2>Garden Sounds</h2><p>Press the sign on each page to hear these wonderful garden sounds and noises.

His aim was to take stock of the nation&#39;s public face and private parts (as it were), and to analyse what precisely it was he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite; a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy; place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowells; people who said &#39;Mustn&#39;t grumble&#39;, and &#39;Ooh lovely&#39; at the sight of a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits; and Gardeners&#39; Question Time. Notes from a Small Island was a huge number-one bestseller when it was first published, and has become the nation&#39;s most loved book about Britain, going on to sell over two million copies.</p><p>Reacting to an itch common to Midwesterners since there's been a Midwest from which to escape, writer Bill Bryson moved from Iowa to Britain in 1973. Working for such places as <i>Times</i> of London, among others, he has lived quite happily there ever since. Now Bryson has decided his native country needs him--but first, he's going on a roundabout jaunt on the island he loves. <p> Britain fascinates Americans: it's familiar, yet alien; the same in some ways, yet so different. Bryson does an excellent job of showing his adopted home to a Yank audience, but you never get the feeling that Bryson is too much of an outsider to know the true nature of the country. <i>Notes from a Small Island</i> strikes a nice balance: the writing is American-silly with a British range of vocabulary. Bryson's marvelous ear is also in evidence: "... I noted the names of the little villages we passed through--Pinhead, West Stuttering, Bakelite, Ham Hocks, Sheepshanks ..." If you're an Anglophile, you'll devour <i>Notes from a Small Island</i>.</p>"Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved about Britain--which is to say, all of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every last bit of it, good and bad--old churches, country lanes, people saying 'Mustn't grumble' and 'I'm terribly sorry but,' people apologizing to <i>me</i> when I conk them with a careless elbow, milk in bottles, beans on toast, haymaking in June, seaside piers, Ordinance Survey maps, tea and crumpets, summer showers and foggy winter evenings--every bit of it."<br><br>After nearly two decades in Britain, Bill Bryson, the acclaimed author of such bestsellers as <i>The Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America</i>, decided it was time to move back to the United States for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was partly to let his wife and kids experience life in Bryson's homeland--and partly because he had read that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thus clear to him that his people needed him.<br><br>But before leaving his much-loved home in North Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around Britain, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;His aim was to take stock of modern-day Britain, and to analyze what he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite, zebra crossings, and place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey, and Shellow Bowells.<br><br>With characteristic wit and irreverence, Bill Bryson presents the ludicrous and the endearing in equal measure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a hilarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain.</p><h2>Song of the Ovulum (Volume 1) (Children of the Bard)</h2><p><p>It has been fifteen years since Billy and Bonnie Bannister helped repel the demonic assault on Heaven.

All of Davis' books contain a creative, allegorical take on Biblical figures and events, unheard-of fantasy elements like anthrozils (human/dragon hybrids), and multifaceted plots that go beyond imagination.<br><br>This latest adventure, Song of the Ovulum, is no exception. It has Davis' signature blend of heart-stopping action and heart-stirring emotion. All the characters that I love from the two previous series are back. Plus, there are great new characters to meet like Billy &amp; Bonnie's kids, and Listeners Joran and Selah. I was especially moved by Joran as he struggled to forgive the woman who murdered his sister. Through his journey Joran learns that if you keep holding tightly to bitterness, you will find that you are strangling yourself.<br><br>Such priceless words of wisdom are another reason why this story is a must read.

Surrounded by rainforest and mountains, inaccessible and remote, this garden has endured for over eighty years. It is powerful with story, rich with legend and history, and Margaret Horsfield&#x2019;s book brings all these elements together in her critically-acclaimed book. Cougar Annie's Garden has been widely acclaimed in Canada since its publication. <p>In 1915 Ada Annie Rae-Arthur came to this part of the coast as a pioneer settler. She set to work clearing the land. What emerged was no ordinary stump farm out in the bush, it was a vision, a dream and a passion. Slowly, over the years, a garden of strange, mesmerising beauty took shape in its clearing in the deep forest, featuring hundreds of varieties of imported shrubs and trees and perennials. </p><p>Wily and stubborn , Ada Annie operated a mail-order nursery garden; she also ran a general store and a post office from her home. She bore eight of her eleven children here, and she outlived and outworked four husbands. A crack shot and a skilled trapper, she became a cougar bounty hunter, killing over seventy of the big cats. She became known as Cougar Annie. Until she was in her mid-nineties, she remained in her beloved garden, </p><p>Many types of West coast lore, many strands of history combine in this book to weave together Cougar Annie&#x2019;s story. Many tales are told of the grim courage, blind hope and bitter losses that have shaped history here. </p><p>Time plays ironic tricks on this isolated part of the coast. Failed enterprises lie rotting in the bush. The population has diminished. Settlements and homesteads have been abandoned. The ver landscape has been radically altered because of the logging in this part of Clayoquot Sound. People have left and dreams have died, all around here. </p><p>Cougar Annie&#x2019;s Garden tells of a dream that has survived, and lives on. Against all odds, this remarkable garden has outlived its equally remarkable owner. Although it was radically overgrown at the time of her death in 1985, it has now been completely restored, and now enters a new era. Thriving with fresh energy and beauty, the garden stands sentinel on this part of the coast, an indomitable survivor. </p><p>The non-profit Boat Basin Foundation is taking over ownership and administration of the garden, its aim being to preserve the garden and to establish a site for botanical field study in Clayoquot Sound. Construction on study cabins has now begun and the first group of students, from San Francisco, has already spent time at the garden on a study trip. </p><p>This is Margaret Horsfield&#x2019;s fourth book. It features art work by Takao Tanabe and Briony Penn and a foreword by Peter C. Newman. In the spring of 2000 this book received the Roderick Haig-Brown award for best book about British Columbia during the past year; it was also shortlisted for the Hubert Evans non-fiction prize and it was runner-up for the Lieutenant-Governor&#x2019;s medal for historical writing about British Columbia. </p><p>The book is a full colour production, with over 100 colour pictures and 50 black and whites.</p></p><p>Cougar Annie&#39;s Garden is Margaret Horsfield&#39;s fourth book.

They halted at the edge of the trees, silently regarding summer fields thick with oats and the brooding castle beyond.<br>&#x201c;Castle Coorm,&#x201d; the leader, Fallion, whispered. &#x201c;As promised.&#x201d; The sight of it filled him with nostalgia and soothed his frayed nerves like mulled wine.<br>The pre-dawn sky still had one bright star in it, and the castle mostly lay in shadows, the limned walls looking soft blue instead of white. There were pinpricks of yellow in the tower windows, and watch-fires burned outside the city gates like blistering gems. The dancing fires, the smell of the smoke, beckoned him. But Fallion merely stood silently regarding the scene. The castle was falling into ruins, but was obviously still inhabited.<br>He had seen too much devastation, too many ruined cities since his return to Mystarria. The Courts of Tide had been laid waste. Its once-fair streets were now dark lanes, blockaded by gangs that fought like wild dogs to protect their few scraps of food and clothing. The women and children there had a haunted look. They had suffered too much rape, too much plunder.<br>The sight of it had left Fallion reeling. In a more perfect world, he told himself, the women would wear flowers in their hair, and children would not learn to fear strangers.<br>Upon the death of Fallion&#x2019;s father, Gaborn Val Orden, assassins from a dozen lands had descended upon Mystarria, hoping to strike down Fallion and his brother. These weren&#x2019;t ordinary assassins. These were powerful runelords that had taken brawn, stamina, speed, and grace from their subjects, making them warriors that no commoner could hope to withstand. And though Mystarria had been a wealthy country then, with many strong runelords of its own, it could not withstand the sustained onslaughts of such men.<br>Only by strengthening its forces could it hope to survive, but that required forcibles&#x2014;magical branding irons that could draw out an attribute from a vassal and then imbue it upon the lord.<br>But there was a dearth of forcibles. The rare blood metal from which they were made was running out. Rumors said that the lords of Kartish, far to the west, were hoarding what little they found, intent on protecting their own realms in the dark times to come.<br>Chancellor Westhaven, who had been left in charge of Mystarria, had even taken a journey to Kartish, hoping to sway those who had once been allies.<br>He had never returned. Some said that his mournful spirit could be seen at night in the towers at the Courts of Tide, wandering the hallways, rummaging through the empty lock-boxes in the treasure room.<br>And so Mystarria had been attacked on a dozen fronts, like a great bull taken down by jackals that ripped it apart and gorged themselves while leaving their prey still only half alive. Its treasuries had been looted, its towers knocked down, its farms and cities burned, its lands divided. The Warlords of Internook held the coast, while Beldinook took the east, and Crowthen to the north split the rest.<br>Frankly, after the rapes, the looting, and the murder, Fallion did not see that there was much of a country left worth fighting over.<br>He eyed the remains of Castle Coorm, dully surprised to see it still intact.<br>The towers of the castle stood, but dark stands of ivy grew up them, looking like rents in the darkness. The eastern-most walls were a decrepit gray, most of the lime having washed away after years of winter storms. A lone bullfrog bellowed amid the placid reeds of the moat.<br>Fallion held to the shadows. He wore a gray half-cape, fastened with a silver cape pin in the form of an owl, long black hair sweeping back over his shoulders, brown eyes so full of light that they seemed a perfect mirror for the distant fires. A naked blade gleamed silver in his hand.<br>He studied the fires, and for an instant an image came to mind of a vast rune made of flames, encircled by flames&#x2014;The Seal of the Inferno. It had been almost three years ago that he had first seen it in a dream while staring into the hearth after a midwinter&#x2019;s dinner. Since then he had begun practicing his skills as a flameweaver, listening to the many tongues of fire, seeking inspiration in sunlight. He knew which direction the seal lay, deep in the Underworld. The wheel of fire haunted him, came to mind a hundred times a day. He could not so much as glance at the sun or even a silver moon without seeing the afterimage of the rune imprinted on his retina.<br>He had crossed the oceans to find it. Just a couple hundred more miles now, and he would descend into the Mouth of the World, hoping to locate the Seal of the Inferno and repair the damage to it. By mending its defects and binding it to the Seal of Heaven and the Seal of Earth, he hoped to restore balance to the world, to remake it in the perfect image of the One True World of legend.<br>Behind him came Rhianna, following so close at Fallion&#x2019;s back that she touched him. Her fierce blue eyes looked troubled, and she clung to her quarterstaff as if she was lost at sea and it was the only thing that might save her from drowning.<br>&#x201c;I remember this place,&#x201d; she said, her voice shaky. &#x201c;I remember...&#x201d;<br>She placed a hand on Fallion&#x2019;s shoulder and just stood. Her flawless face was white with shock, a grimace of pain formed by the slash of her lips.<br>For nearly a decade, Rhianna had blocked out her memories of this place. But now, Fallion could see, they threatened to overwhelm her.<br>At her back stood Fallion&#x2019;s younger brother, Jaz, followed by their foster sister, Talon. Jaz carried a war bow carved from ruddy red reaver&#x2019;s horn. Talon bore a light saber that some dainty gentleman might have worn for a night on the town, but in her practiced hands, the blade would never be confused for a mere adornment.<br>&#x201c;What do you remember?&#x201d; Fallion asked Rhianna.<br>Rhianna&#x2019;s brows drew together in concentration; she recalled racing down a mountain on a force horse that had been richly endowed with runes of brawn and metabolism. Fallion sat in the saddle ahead of her, and she clung to him for dear life. Even then she realized that she was falling in love with him. She remembered thinking him strong and handsome, and she prayed that he would be able to save her. They must have been traveling at eighty miles per hour, for the pines at the margin of the road seemed to fly past. Her heart pounded as if trying to beat its way out of her chest, and in her young mind, she could not imagine that she would live until she reached the castle. Her stomach had ached, and she worried that something was eating her. A strengi-saat had placed its eggs in her womb to hatch, and the young were eating their way out. She remembered it all.<br>&#x201c;We were being chased by monsters,&#x201d; Rhianna said, suddenly planting her staff firmly in the ground. She had been a child back then, with a child&#x2019;s fears. But for years she had been practicing with weapons, and she was growing dangerous. The staff that she bore now was bejeweled and covered in runes. It had once belonged to the Earth King himself. She grimaced. &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re back, and we&#x2019;re the monsters.&#x201d;<br>Jaz laughed. He always seemed to be light of heart lately. Rhianna had come on this journey because she loved Fallion, because she would throw herself in death&#x2019;s path to protect him. But Jaz had come because, as he&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been following him around since I could crawl. I don&#x2019;t see why I should stop now.&#x201d;<br>Jaz said, &#x201c;I was sure we&#x2019;d blundered past this place ten leagues back. And look, there are people inside. You think if we beg nicely, they&#x2019;d part with a mug of ale?&#x201d;<br>Jaz sat down and tried pulling off a boot. It had mud inside and came free with a sucking sound.<br>&#x201c;People will do astonishing things for money,&#x201d; Fallion said, &#x201c;even part with perfectly good ale.&#x201d;<br>He turned back to the castle. The long war had taken its toll. A village had once thrived on the hill below, a place named Weeds. A few dozen cozy mud-and-wattle cottages had grown up here with roofs thatched from wheat straw. As a child, Fallion had imagined that they were living things, lounging among the herb and flower gardens, partitioned with rock walls. The homes had been shaded in the long summer by fruit trees.<br>He regarded the ruins of a cottage on a knoll, and suddenly had a memory from when he was a child of three. In it, his father had come home from his wanderings, and had taken him out into the village among the crowds. Fallion had ridden on his father&#x2019;s shoulder, until his father stopped beneath a cherry tree on the knoll. There, Fallion pulled the red cherries from the tree, and they were so ripe that they burst at his touch, and juice ran thick down his fingers. He licked it off and picked his fill, all the while begriming his father, he was sure now.<br>But his father had only laughed with delight.<br>Fallion remembered riding upon the shoulders of a king, being taller than everyone, looking down upon men that had dwarfed him, wishing that he could be that tall forever.<br>He smiled. It was a good memory, and one of only a handful that he recalled of his father. The journey across the ocean had been worth making just for that.<br>But no cottages graced the fields anymore. Nothing was left but burned-out remains: their rocky husks down in the distance looked like dead beetles.<br>The folk in the castle had probably burned the houses so that the monsters would not be able to hide in them. Strengi-saats, the enemy was called in the old tongue, the &#x201c;strong ones.&#x201d;<br>And it was rumored that worse things had begun to haunt the woods. It was rumored that one of them might even haunt Castle Coorm.<br>&#x201c;Castle Coorm has become an island, a refuge of stone besieged by a wilderness of trees,&#x201d; Fallion ...</p></p><h2>Facts of Life: Stories</h2><p>What do Gaby Lopez, Michael Robles, and Cynthia Rodriguez have in common?

His baseball cap, which he customarily wore with the bill turned back, faced forward. He needed all the disguise he could find. His spirits had fallen to the level of his dragging shoelaces. <p></p><p></p>His mind played back the pain of his failure. He grimaced as he recalled hurling down his bat. Then he had irrationally blamed the swirl of dust that kicked up just as he swung through the third pitch and ended the game, 5&#x2013;4. <p></p><p></p>"Stupid dust!" he had yelled. He scrubbed his eyes to make his point. But his teammates, who had been clinging hopefully to the chain-link fence, just groaned and began to gather their equipment. <p></p><p></p>Now, to make himself feel better, Mickey bought food and drink. The owner of the store was a friend of his father&#x2019;s, so the boy was allowed to ignore the scrawled sign above the magazine rack that read: BUY THE MAGAZINE&#x2014;DON&#x2019;T JUST READ IT. <p></p><p></p>He was eyeballing the latest issue of Lowrider magazine when a man whispered, "Oye, kid, you need work?" Mickey jumped, startled not by the man breathing down on him&#x2014;and the fact that he was tattooed to his throat&#x2014;but by the word he despised most of all. Work. As in pick up a shovel? he thought. As in weed the flower bed? As in get an old towel from the garage and wash the car? <p></p><p></p>"What?" Mickey asked weakly. "Did you say . . . work?" <p></p><p></p>The man&#x2019;s eyes were small in his large face, but that was the only thing small about him: He was barrel-chested, with muscle-packed shoulders and huge arms and legs. He stood just a few inches taller than Mickey, but much mightier. <p></p><p></p>"Yeah, kid, I&#x2019;m looking for someone to help me move things. I&#x2019;m paying good&#x2014;thirty dollars&#x2014;if you can spare a couple hours." <p></p><p></p>The man had to retrieve items from his grandfather&#x2019;s house. Old Gramps, the man quipped, had eaten too much menudo in his time and had suffered a heart attack. He touched his heart, and then the gold dollar sign that dangled from a large gold chain around his neck. <p></p><p></p>Mickey, seeing that this hombre was connected to a larger economy than the two quarters in his own pocket, became interested. At home he slaved for nothing&#x2014;or next to nothing, just a dollar or two. Now this man was offering Mickey thirty bucks. <p></p><p></p>"How long will it take?" <p></p><p></p>"Not long," the man answered. "You&#x2019;re a strong-looking dude." <p></p><p></p>Mickey inflated his chest and held the air as long as he could before slowly releasing it. "Okay," he agreed. <p></p><p></p>He finished his soda and crushed the can in his fist, which made the man whistle and say, "You&#x2019;re strong, I&#x2019;m telling you." Mickey smiled proudly and again inflated his chest. <p></p><p></p>Soon Mickey was in an old squeaky truck moving down Fruit Street. He noticed the radio was gone. "Your truck get jacked?" <p></p><p></p>"What?" <p></p><p></p>Mickey pointed at the cavern full of loose wires. <p></p><p></p>"Yeah," the man muttered, head shaking in disgust. "These be bad times. People just taking what they want." He scratched a tattoo that read born to lose on his bicep. "But you know what the worst theft is?" <p></p><p></p>Mickey shook his head. <p></p><p></p>"It&#x2019;s when someone steals your soul." <p></p><p></p>Profound, Mickey thought. The dude sounds like my dad when he&#x2019;s kicking it in his recliner and complaining about the government. <p></p><p></p>The man introduced himself as Raul. <p></p><p></p>"I got a friend at school named Raul," Mickey said. "Him and me want to start a rock group." <p></p><p></p>"Is that right?" Raul asked. "What instrument you play?" <p></p><p></p>"Nothing right now, but we&#x2019;re going to learn." <p></p><p></p>"I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re gonna make it. And if not in music, then in sports. Bet you play ball, huh?" <p></p><p></p>Mickey beamed. "Yeah, actually, I play slow-pitch." His recent outing, he figured, had been a fluke. The stupid dust messed him up&#x2014;dust and everyone looking at him from the dugout. <p></p><p></p>Mickey spied a car approaching from the opposite direction. It was his father&#x2019;s car. A zipper of fear ran up his back. What would his father think of his son in a truck driven by a total stranger? He was only thirteen. Or would his father be proud that he had found work? <p></p><p></p>"Is this place far?" Mickey felt nervous. "My mom likes me to be home by five." He caught sight of a tattoo in Lowrider script, carlos, on the guy&#x2019;s wrist. Which is it? Mickey wondered. Raul or Carlos? <p></p><p></p>"Nah, it&#x2019;s just right around here," Raul answered. <p></p><p></p>The truck turned a corner. They were in a nice part of their small city, with flowers standing up in well-fertilized soil and sharing their pretty faces with passersby. Automatic sprinklers were spinning out water on supergreen lawns. <p></p><p></p>"It&#x2019;s one of these," Raul said. He peered out the windshield splotched with the horrible deaths of insects. <p></p><p></p>Mickey was certain his widowed aunt lived on this street. Her husband had died while ordering a hamburger. This was just about all he remembered about his uncle, a baker who went to bed before the good television programs started and got up while it was still night. <p></p><p></p>Raul searched for a house, braked, backed the truck up a few feet, and crept into the driveway, cutting the engine and letting the truck roll until it stopped. The house was near the corner, and its lawn sparkled from a recent soaking. A flag with smiling bunnies and turtles on it hung by the door. <p></p><p></p>"Your grandfather lives here?" To Mickey, the house didn&#x2019;t seem very Mexican, and Raul, dark as a penny, was puro homie. <p></p><p></p>"That&#x2019;s right. You wait here &#x2019;cause I got to go around the back and get the key." Raul jumped out of the truck and disappeared through a gate at the side of the house. <p></p><p></p>Mickey wrote his name on the dusty dashboard, then leaped from the truck. Before he slammed the door, he noticed six or seven cell phones under the passenger&#x2019;s seat, maybe more. Was Raul a thief? <p></p><p></p>"Dang," he whispered. Was he, a tender seventh grader, being pulled into a crime that would send him to juvie until he was seventeen? By then, his voice would have deepened like a frog&#x2019;s. <p></p><p></p>Mickey didn&#x2019;t dwell on this question because Raul had appeared on the porch. "Come on, champ," he called with a wave. Somehow, Mickey couldn&#x2019;t disappoint this guy&#x2014;he was sort of cool with all his tattoos. <p></p><p></p>Once inside the house, he was greeted by cool air, a tidy living room, and bright artificial flowers in a vase. Raul closed the door behind them and pointed to a huge television. Mickey whistled. It could have been an altar in a church because a cross and a picture of Jesus sat on top. <p></p><p></p>"We&#x2019;re going to move this?" Mickey sidled up to the television and perceived that it was taller than he. <p></p><p></p>"Yeah, that&#x2019;s why I need you, champ." Mickey sensed Raul was trying to stroke him with a compliment. Still, he wasn&#x2019;t about to confront him and ask, "Hey, dude, you a thief? How come you got a tattoo that says Carlos?" <p></p><p></p>It was just too late. <p></p><p></p>Raul unplugged the television, tossed the cross and picture of Jesus onto the couch, and started to wrestle the TV from the wall. Together they moved one end, then the other, and walked the monstrous television across the living room to the front door. During this straining effort Mickey laid his eyes on framed photographs on the wall. One was of an elderly white couple, and below them were photographs of pinkish children. A flood of sweat sprang to his face. The zippers of fear went crazy on his back. <p></p><p></p>Face moist with sweat, Raul pulled at the front of his tank top and fanned himself. "Go get me a soda." <p></p><p></p>"What?" <p></p><p></p>"In the kitchen. Grab me and you a cold one." Raul pulled out a white handkerchief and ran it across his face and neck. <p></p><p></p>It&#x2019;s stolen, Mickey reckoned. The handkerchief belongs to the old man in the picture. Raul was not the kind of guy who carried an ironed handkerchief white as snow. He must have cased the place&#x2014;were the old folks on vacation?&#x2014;and broken in, discovered a huge television on which to watch the Raiders in the fall, and recruited a naive soul in the shape of a thirteen-year-old strikeout king. <p></p><p></p>Be cool, Mickey reminded himself. He did what Raul asked and fetched two sodas. "Your grandfather is he, like, going to get better?" A split second later, he wished he could pull in that sentence like a fishing line. Why did he ask it? <p></p><p></p>Raul leveled a mean, snakelike stare at Mickey. The moment was so quiet that he could hear a leaky faucet drip in the kitchen. <p></p><p></p>Raul softened and answered, "Yeah, mi abuelito is gonna get better. The guy is strong, you know. He served in Nam and came back to pick grapes for fifteen years. Can you believe that?" He burped and added that his grandfather was a swell fellow who would give the shirt off his back. <p></p><p></p>"Times was hard then, huh?" Mickey thought of his own Mexican-born grandfather, who, according to family lore, walked five miles through a sandy desert to get to school. His grandfather, often lit with drink, reminded them every Christmas that he&#x2019;d only gone up to eighth grade. He wanted his grandchildren to study hard and get jobs in office buildings where the air conditioning was free. <p></p><p></p>"You got that right, homie." Raul downed his soda, tossed the empty can on the couch, and ordered, "Back to work. Got that twenty dollars waiting for you." <p></p><p></p>Miffed that Raul had lowered his pay, Mickey nearly braved correcting him. He would need the full thirty dollars to...</p><h2>Cash Flow Planning: The Nuts and Bolts of Budgeting</h2><p>In this 85-minute lesson, Dave walks you through a step-by-step method for setting-up a household budget that you can live with.

Slowed by a wooden leg and haunted by memories of the Korean War, Rory runs bootleg whiskey for a powerful mountain clan in a retro-fitted '40 Ford coupe. Between deliveries to roadhouses, brothels, and private clients, he lives with his formidable grandmother, evades federal agents, and stokes the wrath of a rival runner.</p><p>In the mill town at the foot of the mountains - a hotbed of violence, moonshine, and the burgeoning sport of stock-car racing - Rory is bewitched by the mysterious daughter of a snake-handling preacher. His grandmother, Maybelline &#x201c;Granny May&#x201d; Docherty, opposes this match for her own reasons, believing that "some things are best left buried." A folk healer whose powers are rumored to rival those of a wood witch, she concocts potions and cures for the people of the mountains while harboring an explosive secret about Rory&#x2019;s mother - the truth behind her long confinement in a mental hospital, during which time she has not spoken one word.

He confesses that at one particularly low moment in the late '50s, he was dredged up from the Slough of Despond by reading the works Albert Camus, whose gaze over a deeper abyss gave Fulghum hope. It was that experience that led Fulghum to seek out writings with uplifting messages. The result is this compilation of brief passages from the likes of Wallace Stevens ("After the final no there comes a yes"), Tom Robbins ("Real courage is risking one's clich�s"), and Buckminster Fuller ("God is a verb").In Words I Wish I Wrote, Robert Fulghum reveals the works of writers who have inspired him. During the past four decades he's reviewed and revised the basic principles of his philosophy many times, sometimes as an exercise in personal growth, but more often in response to individual crisis. Then at fifty, seeking a simplicity to counter the complex thinking of his college years, Fulghum wrote a summary essay professing that all he really needed to know he learned in kindergarten. As he approached his sixtieth year, Fulghum became curious about what in his outlook had changed and what had endured.<p>On review, Fulghum explains, everything he has ever said and thought and written is transparent to him now. As hard as he has tried to speak in his own voice, much of what he's said is neither original nor unique. The best ideas are often old and are continually being revived, recycled, renewed. Wherever his search took him, Fulghum found that someone else has been there before. And more often than not, that person has chosen words Fulghum wishes he had written, using language he can't improve upon. To Fulghum, however, this isn't a discouraging realization. It's a recognition of companionship, which is an affirming consolation.</p><p>The confirming statements, quotes, and credos that Fulghum recorded in his journals for years are collected here, representing the most important ideas underlying his living and thinking. They are organized thematically into such chapters as Companions, God, Bene-Dictions, Contra-Dictions, Simplify, and Believe. Each begins with Fulghum's own insightful, introductory words, followed by inspiring passages drawn from a diverse group of sources, from Jerry Garcia toAlbert Camus, Dylan Thomas to Franz Kafka. At the end of each chapter, Fulghum offers readers his own personal commentary on the sources -- where he was introduced to their words, why he returns to them again and again, and how they may change you.</p></p><h2>Toll House Heritage Cookbook: A Collection of Favorite Dessert Recipes</h2><p>Revised Edition.

His farm is an intricate network of terraces, raised beds, ponds, waterways and tracks, well covered with productive fruit trees and other vegetation, with the farmhouse neatly nestling amongst them. This is in dramatic contrast to his neighbours spruce monocultures. In this book, Sepp shares the skill and knowledge acquired over his lifetime. He covers every aspect of his farming methods, not just how to create a holistic system on the farm itself, but how to make a living from it. He writes about everything from the overall concepts, down to the practical details. Sepp offers a wealth of information for the gardener, smallholder or alternative farmer, yet the books greatest value is the attitude it teaches, he reveals the thinking processes based on principles found in nature that create his successful systems. These can be applied by anyone anywhere, and Sepp is increasingly recognised as a leading figure in agriculture.</p><p>Josef (&#39;Sepp&#39;) Holzer was born in the Province of Salzburg, Austria. He is a farmer, author and an international consultant for natural agriculture. He took over his parents mountain farm business in 1962 and pioneered the use of ecological farming, or permaculture, techniques at high altitudes (1,100 to 1,500 meters above sea level) after being unsuccessful with regular farming methods. Sepp has also created some of the world&#39;s best examples of using ponds as reflectors to increase solar gain for passive solar heating of structures, and of using the microclimate created by rock outcrops to effectively change the hardiness zone for nearby plants. Sepp conducts permaculture (&#39;Holzer Permaculture&#39;) seminars at his farm and worldwide, while continuing to work on his alpine farm. His farm now spans over 45 hectares of forest gardens, with 70 ponds, and is said to be the most consistent example of permaculture worldwide. He is author of several books and the subject of the film The Agricultural Rebel.There, at an altitude which everyone else has abandoned to low-value forestry, what is probably the best example of a permaculture farm in Europe stands out like a beacon.

He gives us a fresh assessment of the great statesman, who enjoys even greater influence today than in his own time. Russell Kirk was a leading figure in the post-World War II revival of American interest in Edmund Burke. Today, no one who takes seriously the problems of society dares remain indifferent to "the first conservative of our time of troubles." In Russell Kirk&#x2019;s words: "Burke&#x2019;s ideas interest anyone nowadays, including men bitterly dissenting from his conclusions. If conservatives would know what they defend, Burke is their touchstone; and if radicals wish to test the temper of their opposition, they should turn to Burke." Kirk lucidly unfolds Burke&#x2019;s philosophy, showing how it revealed itself in concrete historical situations during the eighteenth century and how Burke, through his philosophy, "speaks to our age." <br><br>This volume makes vivid the four great struggles in the life of Burke: his efforts to reconcile England with the American colonies; his involvements in cutting down the domestic power of George III; his prosecution of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India; and his resistance to Jacobinism, the French Revolution&#x2019;s "armed doctrine." In each of these great phases of his public life, Burke fought with passionate eloquence and relentless logic for justice and for the proper balance of order and freedom. With sure instinct born of his sympathy and understanding, Kirk gives us the incisive quotation, the illuminating highlight, the moving, all-too-human elements that bring Burke and his age to vivid life. Thanks to Russell Kirk&#x2019;s skillful evocations, Edmund Burke in these pages becomes our contemporary. "Because corruption and fanaticism assail our era as sorely as they did Burke&#x2019;s time, the resonance of Burke&#x2019;s voice still is heard amidst the howl of our winds of abstract doctrine."</p>Dr. Kirk was one of this century's foremost men of letters. He was the founder of the conservative quarterlies <i>Modern Age</i> and <i>The University Bookman</i>. <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,<i> Edmund Burke</i>, <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, <i>Enemies of the Permanent Things</i>, and <i>Eliot and His Age</i> are among his over thirty books.</p><h2>Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe</h2><p>When scientists peer through a telescope at the distant stars in outer space or use a particle-accelerator to analyze the smallest components of matter, they discover that the same laws of physics govern the whole universe at all times and all places. Physicists call the eternal, ubiquitous constancy of the laws of physics symmetry. Symmetry is the basic underlying principle that defines the laws of nature and hence controls the universe. This all-important insight is one of the great conceptual breakthroughs in modern physics and is the basis of contemporary efforts to discover a grand unified theory to explain all the laws of physics.Nobel Laureate Leon M. Lederman and physicist Christopher T. Hill explain the supremely elegant concept of symmetry and all its profound ramifications to life on Earth and the universe at large in this eloquent, accessible popular science book. They not only clearly describe concepts normally reserved only for physicists and mathematicians, but they also instill an appreciation for the profound beauty of the universe&#39;s inherent design.Central to the story of symmetry is an obscure, unpretentious, but extremely gifted German mathematician named Emmy Noether. Though still little known to the world, she impressed no less a scientist than Albert Einstein, who praised her &#34;penetrating mathematical thinking.&#34; In some of her earliest work she proved that the law of the conservation of energy was connected to the idea of symmetry and thus laid the mathematical groundwork for what may be the most important concept of modern physics.Lederman and Hill reveal concepts about the universe, based on Noether&#39;s work, that are largely unknown to the public and have wide-reaching implications in connection with the Big Bang, Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and many other areas of physics. Through ingenious analogies and illustrations, they bring these astounding notions to life. This book will open your eyes to a universe you never knew existed.</p><p>The idea that an object's appearance can remain the same after some sort of physical change is both aesthetically pleasing and mathematically interesting, whether one is observing a delicate snowflake or appreciating a majestic Bach organ fugue. Yet in the twentieth century, humans discovered that this principle means a great deal more - the very structure of nature depends on it. <p>When scientists peer through telescopes at distant galaxies or use gigantic particle accelerators to examine the fabric of matter, they find universal and steadfast laws of physics governing the whole universe, at all times and places. Physicists recognize this as a form of symmetry, which is now believed to be the basic underlying principle that controls the universe. This insight is one of the greatest conceptual breakthroughs of modern science and drives the contemporary effort to discover a grand unification of all the laws of physics, such as superstring theory. </p><p>In SYMMETRY AND THE BEAUTIFUL UNIVERSE, Nobel laureate Leon M. Lederman and theoretical physicist Christopher T. Hill explain the elegant concept of symmetry and its profound ramifications for art, music, and life of Earth, from quarks to the universe at large. This eloquent and accessible work of popular science not only illuminates concepts normally reserved only for physicists and mathematicians but also portrays the profound beauty of nature's inherent design. </p><p>Central to the story of symmetry is an ascetic, unpretentious, and gifted mathematician named Emmy Noether. Though still little known to the world, she dazzled no less a savant than Albert Einstein, who praised her "penetrating mathematical thinking."

Tomasso Campanella, a Calabrian monk, published <i>The City of the Sun</i> in 1623, and Francis Bacon's <i>The New Atlantis</i> appeared in 1627. Campanella was a student of logic and physics who formulated the first scientifically based socialistic system &#x2014; one that furnished a model for subsequent ideal communities. Bacon focused on politics and philosophy, emphasizing the duty of the state toward science. Despite the authors' differences in setting and treatment, each of these 17th-century classics mirrors the period's prevailing thought, reflecting the idealism of an age and its revolutionary trends in philosophy.</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world. The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.The New Atlantis by Lord Bacon is one of the most important of the Utopian writings because it envisions the advancements in all branches of learning in the Western Hemisphere. Strangely enough, Plato's description of the ancient Atlantean empire and Bacon's New Atlantis both end suddenly in the middle of a sentence. In 1660 a mysterious person known only as R.H. Esquire attempted to complete Bacon's unfinished book. There was never but one edition of New Atlantis Continued by R.H. Esquire. <p>This extremely rare literary curiosity belongs in all collections of Elizabethan literature and is invaluable to students of Bacon's writings and the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy. </p><p>The new edition is reset for the convenience of the modern reader, but there are no changes except the modernization of spelling and punctuation. The discussion of heraldry is of great interest to those collecting emblem books and cryptographic material in general.

Although the lectures are not currently published as part of the standard works, it is evident that they were held in high esteem by the Prophet Joseph Smith and those that followed him. President Joseph Fielding Smith said that these Lectures are of great value and should be studied. I consider them to be of extreme value in the study of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Bruce R. McConkie has classified the lectures as some of the best lesson material ever prepared on the Godhead; on the character, perfections, and attributes of God; on faith, miracles, and sacrifice.<p> The seven lectures in this collection deal with the following subjects: What is faith? What is the role of revelation in developing faith? What are the attributes of God? Why is it necessary to have a correct knowledge about God's attributes in order to exercise true faith? What is the true nature of the Godhead and what is God's purpose for man? What is the role of sacrifice in building the faith needed for eternal life? What are the effects or results that flow from having true faith?</p></p><p></p><h2>Touched with Fire</h2><p>Kay Jamison&#39;s brilliant work, based on her lifelong studies as a clinical psychologist, reveals that many artists subject to exalted highs and despairing lows are, in fact, struggling with clinical manic-depression.

He lives in Stuyvesant, New York.This visual pilgrimage to the native terrain of a variety of venerable writers suffers from Locker's visually homogeneous treatment of America's diverse landscapes. The journey begins in San Francisco, Robert Frost's birthplace (though most readers likely equate the poet with New England). His "Once by the Pacific" is comprised of strong, clear images: the "great waves" that "thought of doing something to the shore/ That water never did to land before"; the clouds, "low and hairy in the skies." In Locker's painting, however, power is diverted from Frost's fierce flexure of the sea to a purple-to-black sky brooding over agitated water and cliffs glanced by light. Throughout Locker's tour, his brush seems dipped in the Hudson Valley light of his own homeland, and not surprisingly, the standout paintings here are those paired with an excerpt from Washington Irving's "Rip Van Winkle"?depicting a leisurely sail up the Hudson River, the boat dwarfed by the dramatic Kaatskill mountains aflame at sunset?and his own "Birches in the Fall" with white trunks leaning inward, inviting readers down an autumn trail of golden grasses. But when called upon to conjure the Southwest of Pat Mora's "Gold" or the Amish country depicted in Merle Good's "Song of a People," Locker fails to capture the indigenous palette and mood. Unfortunately, the book seems driven by its theme, rather than a celebration of it.

As the close colleague of legendary musicians such as Horowitz, Rubinstein, Gould, Serkin, and many others, Franz Mohr has attended to their instruments, making delicate adjustments that affect tone, balance, and other characteristics of sound. It is Mohr who enables virtuosos to fully realize their own individual interpretative styles and concepts of tonal color. Besides recounting his experiences as master piano technician, Franz Mohr helps us to understand the quest for perfection and sensitivity expressed in the lives of a select group of individuals, in the crafting of a piano, and in all of life. He shares his personal story and how his experiences have brought a deeper melody to his work. The life story of Franz Mohr is a collection of stories that reveal his love for music, the piano, the people who play it, and a God who has given him the talent to be a part of the world he loves.James L.

Sally Mann came to the attention of the public in 1992, with a series of intimate portraits of her children and her reputation has risen since then.</p><p>Sally Mann was born in Lexington, Virginia, in 1951. She has won numerous awards, including three National Endowment for the Arts fellowships and a Guggenheim fellowship. Her photographs have been exhibited internationally and are in the permanent collections of major museums worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Her past publications include Second Sight, At Twelve, Immediate Family, Still Time, and What Remains. A documentary film about Mann's family pictures was nominated for an Academy Award in 1993. A feature-length follow-up is in development and will air on HBO and the BBC. Mann lives in Virginia. <br>Mann rose to prominence with Immediate Family, a collection of photographs of her children that some saw as emotionally direct and others found disturbingly erotic. Regardless, these photographs, and her subsequent work, demonstrate that Mann has a preternatural eye for light and composition. In this book, Mann, inspired by "a cache of glass negatives...of familiar local places," set off with her camera through the South, using eighteenth century photographic techniques to capture the "radical light of the American South," and the results are fascinating. In Georgia, a column of leaves dissipates into a luminous mist; in Virginia, a scumbled field with an empty cart in the distance suggests a test shot by Matthew Brady. Many of these photographs are startling in their intimations of violence: in the section called "Deep South," Mann depicts the thick shaft of a venerable tree with a wound-like, horizontal slash near the trunk. Mann has also included the inevitable mistakes involved with such a tricky process: indiscernible unhappy accidents and washed-out near-abstractions. This is brave but puzzling. In one of her short essays, Mann writes that the Southern dusk makes "the landscape soft and vague, as if inadequately summoned by some shiftless deity, casually neglectful of the details." A god may enjoy such prerogatives, but shouldn't artists be more mindful? Most of the 65 images here are hauntingly beautiful and offer a stunning tour of a very off-the-beaten-path part of the country.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jaffe (of Washingtonian magazine) and Sherwood (of WRC-TV, formerly of the Washington Post) tell their story in episodic sketches, covering the city's historic caste system among blacks, the rise of community organizer (and, later, mayor) Marion Barry during the War on Poverty, and the shift of power to blacks after the traumatic 1968 riots. The authors criticize the long-standing federal stranglehold on the district, as well as the Post's ignorance of black Washington, but their major culprit is ``Boss Barry,'' who emerged in his second mayoral term (1982-6) as a betrayer of the biracial coalition that first elected him. Barry's failures were legion: political spoils for a narrow group of adventurers such as profiteer-from-the-homeless Cornelius Pitts; a top aide turned embezzler; a police department in disarray; a downtown that boomed as other neighborhoods crumbled. His defiance of the black bourgeoisie and the white power structure preserved his popularity among blacks, and when he was arrested on drug charges in 1990--an episode recounted in telling detail--his lawyer successfully argued that the government was out to get him. After serving a six-month jail term for one misdemeanor, Barry began a comeback as council member from the city's poorest ward. The authors criticize the current mayor, reformer Sharon Pratt Kelly, as out of touch, and warn that federal receivership for Washington is as likely as full home rule and statehood. Reliance on dialogue-rich scenes sometimes sacrifices depth for drama, but this is a memorable and disturbing reminder of much unfinished urban business. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Journalists Jaffe and Sherwood, long-time Washington, D.C., residents, have covered that city's politics for many years. Their book is based on interviews with over 200 people (but not former mayor Marion Barry) and a variety of other sources, including congressional hearings and reports, police and court records, and journalistic accounts. While the book traces the history of the city from the Civil War to the present, its central reference point is the 1992 murder of Tom Barnes, a young intern for Alabama senator Richard Shelby, a few blocks from the Capitol and the racial turmoil that arose when the senator questioned the ability of the largely African American government to run the city. Tracing former mayor Barry's career from his civil rights activism to his drug conviction, the authors provide a highly unflattering portrait of his weaknesses for sex, drugs, and political corruption. For them, Barry symbolizes both the tension between civil rights activists and Washington's African American middle class and the promise and subsequent failure of the social programs of the 1960s.

More than anything else, he argues, it is the neglect of consciousness that results in so much barrenness and sterility in psychology, the philosophy of mind, and cognitive science: there can be no study of mind that leaves out consciousness. What is going on in the brain is neurophysiological processes and consciousness and nothing more -- no rule following, no mental information processing or mental models, no language of thought, and no universal grammar. Mental events are themselves features of the brain, "like liquidity is a feature of water."</p><p>Beginning with a spirited discussion of what's wrong with the philosophy of mind, Searle characterizes and refutes the philosophical tradition of materialism. But he does not embrace dualism. All these "isms" are mistaken, he insists. Once you start counting types of substance you are on the wrong track, whether you stop at one or two. In four chapters that constitute the heart of his argument, Searle elaborates a theory of consciousness and its relation to our overall scientific world view and to unconscious mental phenomena. He concludes with a criticism of cognitive science and a proposal for an approach to studying the mind that emphasizes the centrality of consciousness to any account of mental functioning.</p><p>In his characteristically direct style, punctuated with persuasive examples, Searle identifies the very terminology of the field as the main source of truth. He observes that it is a mistake to suppose that the ontology of the mental is objective and to suppose that the methodology of a science of the mind must concern itself only with objectively observable behavior; that it is also a mistake to suppose that we know of the existence of mental phenomena in others only by observing their behavior; that behavior or causal relations to behavior are not essential to the existence of mental phenomena; and that it is inconsistent with what we know about the universe and our place in it to suppose that everything is knowable by us.</p></p><p>John R.

She and her family live in Montana.</p>Miranda Colton floated in a sea of warmth, the sensation unlike any she had ever known. Maybe I&#x2019;ve died, she thought. Maybe I&#x2019;ve died and this is heaven. She attempted to open her eyes to confirm her thoughts, but her eyelids were too heavy. <p>Drifting in and out of a hazy sleep, Miranda knew nothing but the comfort and assurance that all was well. There was no sense of panic. No fear of the unknown. Her spirit rested in complete peace. </p><p>In her dreams, she saw herself as a young child, happily playing in fields of flowers, the mist of the ocean upon her skin, the salty taste upon her lips. She lifted her face to the sun and felt the delicious warmth engulf her. She would like to stay here forever. Safe and warm. Happily contented among the green grasses and colorful flowers. At times, a delicate aroma wafted through the air, delighting her further with the luscious scent of roses, honeysuckle, and lilacs. </p><p>Then voices called to her. Miranda didn&#x2019;t recognize the language, but somehow she knew the words were being spoken to her. She struggled to listen&#x2014;to understand. With great difficulty she opened her eyes and stared into the brown, well-worn face of an old woman. </p><p>Miranda felt no sense of recollection at the sight of the serious countenance before her. The woman was clearly a stranger, yet she seemed so concerned, so gentle. A momentary tremble of fear seized Miranda&#x2019;s heart, but the woman&#x2019;s tender touch made her realize the old woman was no threat to her well-being. </p><p>&#x201c;You wake up now,&#x201d; the woman said in a thick, almost guttural tongue. </p><p>Miranda opened her mouth to reply, but no words came out. Her mouth felt as if it were stuffed with cotton. Closing her eyes, she heard the woman call to her again. </p><p>&#x201c;No sleep. You make too much sleep. You wake up now.&#x201d; </p><p>The command did little good. Miranda had no energy for the task. </p><p>She felt the woman swab her face with a cool cloth. The woman gently urged, &#x201c;You wake up. You no die.&#x201d; </p><p>Die? Miranda wondered at the word as she listened to the woman chatter on. Wasn&#x2019;t she already dead? She couldn&#x2019;t remember what had happened to her, but she was certain that it had been a very difficult journey. It didn&#x2019;t startle her to think of dying or even of being dead. She merely wondered why she couldn&#x2019;t wake up. Weren&#x2019;t you supposed to see pearly gates and hosts of angels after death? Nowhere in her church upbringing could she remember anything about brown-faced women escorting a person to their reward. </p><p>The woman forced water into Miranda&#x2019;s mouth. The cold liquid felt marvelous as it trickled down her throat, dissolving the cotton taste. How very pleasant, Miranda thought. </p><p>&#x201c;How is she?&#x201d; a masculine voice questioned in a decidedly English accent. </p><p>Miranda started to open her eyes, certain that she was about to meet God. Funny, she had never thought of him as an Englishman. She hesitated a moment. Didn&#x2019;t the Bible say that you would die if you saw God&#x2019;s face? </p><p>Then it came to her. If this is God, then I&#x2019;m already dead and it won&#x2019;t matter. She opened her eyes, prepared to meet her maker. Instead, she met the compassionate gaze of dark brown eyes. The man had a gentleness about him as he leaned over her to touch her forehead. </p><p>&#x201c;I say, seems the fever is gone. You&#x2019;ll soon be right as rain.&#x201d; His dark brown mustache twitched ever so slightly as he offered her a smile. </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Miranda barely croaked the word out. </p><p>The man patted her on the head as if she were a small child. &#x201c;Nellie will fix you right up. You&#x2019;ll see. She&#x2019;s quite gifted in the ways of healing.&#x201d; </p><p>Miranda wanted to question the man but had no energy to do so. She watched in silence as he turned to the woman. His alabaster skin was quite the contrast to the older woman&#x2019;s native complexion. His dark hair had a haphazard lay to it. Perhaps he had just awakened, or perhaps he wasn&#x2019;t given to worrying over appearances. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve prepared the herbs you asked for, Nellie. That should help considerably. Shall I put a pot of water on to boil?&#x201d; </p><p>The old woman nodded and followed the man. Miranda wanted to call out to them and beg them not to leave her, but again her voice failed her. She tried to remember what had happened to her. How did I get here? But even as she worked at the foggy memories, Miranda knew only one thing for certain. This wasn&#x2019;t heaven&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t dead.</p></p><h2>Gil&#39;s All Fright Diner</h2><p><p>Bloodier than <i>Fried Green Tomatoes</i>!<br>Funnier than <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>!</p><p>Welcome to Gil's All Night Diner, where zombie attacks are a regular occurrence and you never know what might be lurking in the freezer. . . .</p><p>Duke and Earl are just passing through Rockwood county in their pick-up truck when they stop at the diner for a quick bite to eat.

And of two men.<br><br>Well, not men exactly.<br><br>Earl bounced in his seat as the pickup quaked. His beer slipped and settled in his lap. He grunted curses as he snatched up the can too late to prevent a yellow puddle around his groin.<br><br>Hell, Duke, do you gotta hit every goddamn hole in the road?<br><br>Duke shrugged and offered a mumbled apology.<br><br>Yeah, well just try and watch it.<br><br>Earl reached into the pool of empty beers. Damn it, Duke! If that&#x2019;s the last beer, I&#x2019;m going to have to kick your ass. Like Arthur with Excalibur, he withdrew a full beer. You got lucky. He popped it open and gulped down half its contents.<br><br>Duke grunted.<br><br>How we doing on gas? asked Earl.<br><br>We got enough.<br><br>How much we got?<br><br>Enough.<br><br>Damn it, Duke, can&#x2019;t you just answer a goddamn question?<br><br>Duke took a moment to lean out his window and spit. We got enough, Earl.<br><br>The rusty gray truck bounced down the dusty road, more of a dirt trail really. Worn shocks were helpless against the rocky, hole-ridden roadway, and with each jolt, the engine rattled as if it might rip free. The tape player didn`t work; something the passengers had learned at the cost of a Hank Williams, Jr. cassette. Spools of black tape hung from the radio`s jaws, the inevitable end of an unsuccessful rescue attempt. The passengers rode in silence with only the clatter of seventy-six empty beer cans to fill the quiet. Seventy-six was the exact number of tallboys that could fit in the front seat before space limitations demanded a transfer to the bed.<br><br>The vehicle was an unlikely means of transport for the Earl of Vampires and the Duke of Werewolves. But for a vampire who happened to be named Earl and a werewolf who liked to be called Duke, it was perfectly acceptable. Truth be told, they had called on much worse when the occasion demanded it.<br><br>We got like thirty more miles to the nearest station, y&#x2019;know? Earl glanced at the fuel gauge. It trembled on empty. Shit. Should&#x2019;a filled up at the last place. I told&#x2019;ja, didn&#x2019;t I?<br><br>He contented himself by tossing dirty looks Duke&#x2019;s way the next few minutes.<br><br>The vampire was a stringy fellow, pale&#x2014;as one would expect&#x2014;with an overbite, a large nose, and a ridiculously unsuccessful comb-over. The werewolf was large and hairy, even in his current man form. His monstrous gut barely managed to squeeze behind the steering wheel. A green baseball cap tried, and failed miserably, to contain the thick mane of dark brown hair atop his head. He had never been able to grow a beard, but a permanent five o`clock shadow covered his face.<br><br>Earl wore threadbare overalls that were at least as old as he was. (Which, for the record, was much older than he looked but still not all that old for a vampire.) Duke wore denim jeans, a leather jacket, and a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan NO FAT CHICKS.<br><br>"Next chance we get, Duke, we should get some new tires, too."<br><br>"Tires are fine."<br><br>"This one`s ready to blow."<br><br>"No it ain`t."<br><br>"What the fuck to do you know about tires, dipshit?"<br><br>"I know it ain`t going to blow."<br><br>"Fine, but when it does, you`re changing it."<br><br>"Fine."<br><br>Duke didn`t bother to point out the truck was currently riding on its spare.<br><br>Rattling quiet fell on the cab once again. It lasted through the next half-hour. The pickup`s working headlight cut through the darkness of a cloudy night and sliver of a moon. The occasional forlorn mailbox or animal carcass marked the otherwise unremarkable miles. Finally, a beacon of shimmering neon dared pierce the dark. It was a ten-foot sign beside a bunker of concrete. The sign read GIL`S ALL NIGHT DINER.<br><br>Duke pulled off. "I`m hungry," he explained, before Earl could set about busting his balls.<br><br>Earl set about to busting anyway. "You could`a ate earlier. I told`ja to get something earlier."<br><br>"Wasn`t hungry then." Duke tugged the brim of his cap so that it nearly covered his eyes as he pulled his girth free of the driver`s seat. The pickup`s suspension groaned as the truck rose three inches.<br><br>"You could`a got a sandwich. That`s your problem. You never think ahead. You`re always living in the now. You`ve got one of them there reactive minds."<br><br>Duke cursed the day Earl had gotten his hands on a dog-eared copy of <em>Dianetics</em>.<br><br>The werewolf stopped to sniff the air.<br><br>"Now what?" Earl asked.<br><br>"Nuthin`." He tilted his head. "Thought I smelt sumthin` for a minute there."<br><br>"What? What d`ja think you smell?"<br><br>"Zombies."<br><br>"Jeezus, Duke, there ain`t nuthin` for a hundred miles. Where the hell would zombies come from?"<br><br>"Over there."<br><br>Duke jerked his thumb over his shoulder as he entered the diner. As if on cue, the dust raised by the pickup`s arrival settled, revealing a small cemetery.<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>Duke went inside.<br><br>A big, black raven perched atop the diner&#x2019;s neon sign. The bird tilted its head to stare at Earl with one cruel ebony eye.<br><br>What are you looking at?<br><br>He flung a pebble at the raven but missed. The bird didn&#x2019;t seem to care. It stayed on its perch without ruffling a feather. Sighing, Earl headed inside.<br><br>Duke`s worn hiking boots squeaked with each step across the diner`s worn linoleum floor. Earl`s flip flops mutely thumped. The diner was abnormally large given its desolate location. There were enough booths, tables, and barstools to service a small army. But the room was empty. The overhead lights hummed obnoxiously. Two cheap desert landscapes hung by the bathrooms. A potted fern hung from a support column. A cracked ceramic pot sat in a corner. These efforts failed miserably to add character, and the place was so devoid as to be almost vulgar in its blandness.<br><br>The most eye-catching detail was a brownish red stain, about a foot long at its widest, at the base of the column. A normal person wouldn&#x2019;t give it much thought, mistaking it for rust or mildew. But both Earl and Duke had sensitive noses. It smelled of blood. The stain looked old, but the odor, though subtle, was fresh. <br><br>A voice came from the back. "Be right with you."<br><br>They found seats at the counter. The odor of grease made Duke`s stomach rumble.<br><br>Earl continued with his psychoanalysis. "Now me, I`ve got goals, and my mind acts upon those goals in an enlightened manner. I`ve achieved myself a state of clear. Whereas you just act on whatever impulse enters that fool head of yours."<br><br>"Least I got myself a shadow."<br><br>The vampire glanced at the floor. His shadow was indeed gone again. It did that quite often. Sometimes disappearing for hours or even days. Earl always hated that. He just knew that wherever it went, it was having a better time than him. And when it was in its rightful place, it had a tendency to move around against his will, taunting him and making a general nuisance of itself. Of all the problems of the undead (too many to list, really) the shadow was perhaps the most trivial yet most annoying.<br><br>Knowing how much it bothered Earl, Duke cracked a hint of a smile.<br><br>Earl scoured his mind for a clever comeback. He finally settled for a snarled, "Fuck you."<br><br>The kitchen doors swung open, and a tall, plump woman lurched into the front. She wore a T-shirt and jean cutoffs that hugged her jiggling behind, but only barely. Cellulite rolled down her legs in flapping waves with each step. A soiled apron stretched across her immense breasts. Her hair, a frazzled bleached-blonde mess, slung to the left of her face and just past her shoulders. She smiled, revealing teeth the size and color of corn kernels. A stained tag pinned to her collar had the name Loretta in bright green letters next to a beaming happy face.<br><br>"Morning, boys. What can I get you?"<br><br>Duke fished deep into his pockets and dropped a handful of crumpled bills and eighty-three cents in change. "What`ll that get me?"<br><br>The waitress pushed the money around with the eraser end of her pencil. "Grilled cheese sandwich, some fries, cuppa chili, and a Coke."<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>"Nuthin` for me, thanks, Earl piped in. I already ate."<br><br>Loretta disappeared into the back. Duke, who had seen a man`s fresh innards spilt upon the ground on more than one occasion, averted his eyes from the disagreeable trembling flesh of her exit. Earl was too busy looking for his shadow to notice.<br><br>The waitress`s head bobbed about in the rectangular window that allowed a glimpse into the kitchen. "Where you boys headed?"<br><br>"Nowhere in particular," Earl replied. "Just driving."<br><br>"Nuthin` wrong with that. Hell, sometimes I wish I could pull up stakes and just go wherever the Good Lord sees fit to take me." She slapped something on the grill, and sizzling filled the air. "You boys didn`t see nuthin` strange on your way in, did`ja?"<br><br>Earl snorted. "Strange like what?"<br><br>"Nuthin`. You`d know it if you saw it. So where you from?"<br><br>"Around."<br><br>She grinned. "Sorry, I just get to chatting on these slow nights. Don`t mean to pry into your business."<br><br>Ten minutes later, she set a plate before Duke. The cheese dripped a puddle of grease, and the fries were soggy and brown. The chili was steaming hot, though. He dipped his spoon into the thick brown concoction and took a bite.<br><br>"How is it?" Earl asked.<br><br>"Good. Little heavy on the garlic."<br><br>Duke leaned close and let his traveling companion get a strong whiff of his breath. Earl recoiled, tumbling off his stool and hitting the floor. His nostrils flared, and his face contorted into a scowl.<br><br>"You asshole."<br><br>Duke chuckled.<br></p></p><h2>Perfect Hand Quilting Without Pain</h2><p>Thimblelady&#39;s innovative quilting technique eliminates all physical pains!

The Path to Pearl Harbor</b><p></p><i>But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.</i><p> -- John Quincy Adams on America, 1821</p><p>Looming is an old sea term -- it describes the result of peculiar atmospheric conditions that occur rarely, but most often at sea, in which ships far beyond the furthest horizon may be clearly seen long before they are within visual range. When this happens, sailors and landsmen near shore are treated to a view over the horizon -- a look forward into time. Rural Americans were shocked by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Easterners thought the war would begin in Europe, but students on the West Coast, and those Americans who followed events in Asia more closely during the 1930s, saw war in the Pacific looming over the not so far horizon.</p><p>In 1939, America and Japan were on a collision course. Both their economies were recovering. Defense spending was lifting each nation's economic potential. Shipyards in both nations were being expanded. All the while, a noose in the form of an economic blockade was tightening as America brought increasing pressure on Japan to end its expansion in Asia. Japanese militarists who controlled their government determined they would be overthrown if they capitulated to American demands. These leaders, including Hideki Tojo, realized, too, that they could not defeat the United States in a fair fight. The Japanese concluded that they had one chance: if they could severely damage the American Pacific Fleet -- especially America's carriers -- then the weakened United States, more concerned about the war in Europe, would make peace with Japan.</p><p>It is difficult to rationalize the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and much easier to write it off along with the kamikazes as the irrational act of a fanatical nation gone awry. However, it is important to try to understand the Japanese point of view leading up to the war in the Pacific, and the reasons behind the attack on Pearl Harbor. A detailed analysis is far beyond the scope of this book, but a broad outline may be drawn.</p><p>From the time of the first European settlements in America, a frontier line, descending north to south, separated civilization from wilderness. This line can be seen clearly on maps through the decades, beginning first on the Eastern Seaboard, and moving steadily westward. By the mid-nineteenth century, the western frontier began to merge with American settlements founded on the West Coast that were expanding eastward. By 1890, the census announced that the American frontier no longer existed. For a time, though, America continued to advance westward, beginning a period of colonization and imperialism that directly threatened Japanese hegemony in Asia and the Pacific. America's west, for the first time, did not end at the shores of California.</p><p>This expansion continued an extensive history of confrontation over control of the Pacific. Marines had been sent to Sumatra in 1831. In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry landed in Japan and forced Japan to open trade with America. In the midst of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln sent a U.S. naval vessel to the Sea of Japan to shell the Home Islands and teach the Shogun a lesson about American power and interest in Asia. In the 1870s, when Japan was wresting control of Korea from China, President Ulysses Grant sent naval forces to Korea to burn coastal forts.</p><p>Japanese and American expansion were poised to collide, each determining, as the nineteenth century ended, how to get the most of what was left of Pacific Asia. The de facto annexation of Hawaii in the 1890s put Washington, D.C., 5,000 miles from its farthest borders. Control of the Philippines in 1899 extended American territory westward even beyond Japan.</p><p>Before Perry's visit, Japan knew little of the outside world and considered itself the preeminent nation. But once Japan opened itself to the West, Japanese leaders were shocked by the power of industrialized countries, and determined to force 200 years of economic development into a single generation under the Meiji emperor. Remarkably, they largely succeeded and set their sights on becoming not merely an island nation, but a power on the mainland of Asia.</p><p>Japan fought China in 1894-1895 and won Taiwan and parts of Manchuria. Yet they were forced by the colonial powers, particularly the United States, to take a limited profit from their brutal China war. The Japanese people were told by the emperor that they must "endure the unendurable." (These words were echoed fifty years later by his grandson, Hirohito, when Japan surrendered.) The newly industrialized Japanese devastated the Russian fleet in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. But the United States brokered peace, and again forced the Japanese to lose face -- accepting less than they had won.</p><p>Although Japan was an ally of the United States against Germany during the First World War, the Japanese were insulted when the white Western powers refused to allow a racial equality clause in the peace treaty at Versailles. They again felt slighted when the victorious powers divided up the world and gave Japan only a few island chains considered to have little value -- the Marshalls, the Carolines, and the Marianas. In 1922, again under American pressure, Japan signed a naval treaty in Washington, D.C., which limited the size of its navy to about two thirds the size of the American fleet. </p><p>It wasn't long before the United States and Japan were looking down each other's throats.</p><p>Japan, like the United States, was torn by the Great Depression. Families that had prospered for generations within the traditional Japanese economic system were suddenly undone by new competitive realities as Japan became integrated into the world economy. Japan's leadership grew alarmed at the paucity of jobs and economic possibilities for the growing and increasingly restless population. They feared that Japan would be unable to compete without controlling land beyond the Home Islands, so the military regime continued and extended a foreign policy of aggressive territorial expansion.</p><p>In 1931, the Japanese invaded Manchuria and established a puppet regime called Manchukuo. The subjugation of the Chinese population in the 1930s required an enormous political, economic, and military commitment. Japan sent thousands of otherwise unemployed youths to Manchuria to make it Japanese. They built railroads, roads, bridges, and schools -- especially teaching schools to indoctrinate Chinese into the Japanese system. The Japanese government, like Adolf Hitler's in Germany, began a large-scale buildup of its military financed through deficit spending. This spending lifted the Japanese economy out of the depression and created an alliance between Japanese capitalists and Japanese military cliques. This coalition in turn determined a great deal of the country's national policy -- a policy that led inexorably to war.</p><p>The League of Nations refused to recognize Manchukuo, so Japan withdrew from the League, and refused to sign the new Geneva Convention. Two years later Japan withdrew from the Washington Naval Treaty, which had set proscriptions on the size of the signators' navies. Japan then initiated a rapid expansion of their fleet. By August 1937, Japan was conducting a full-scale war against China, committing violent atrocities, including what is now known as the Rape of Nanking. The world was outraged, but Western powers, hoping to avoid war, did nothing aside from putting forth weak protests. This policy of appeasement emboldened the Japanese militarists.</p><p>By 1940, the Far East and the Pacific were controlled by the great European colonial powers and Japan. The British controlled Australia, India, Burma, northern Borneo, the east coast of New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilberts. The Dutch controlled much of what is now Indonesia and southern Borneo. The Vichy French controlled Indochina (now Vietnam).* The United States controlled the Philippines, Hawaii, Midway, Wake, and Guam.</p><p>In addition to the Home Islands, Japan controlled Manchurian China, Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, much of Sakhalin Island, and the Caroline, Marshall, Bonin, Ryukyu, and Marianas island chains.</p><p>The Japanese island chains in the Pacific were almost unknown to most Americans. Their names now have a deep resonance for anyone with knowledge of the Pacific war. Micronesia includes the island battlegrounds of Palau, Yap, Truk, and about 550 other small islets, including Ulithi Atoll. The Marianas chain includes Saipan, Tinian, and a dozen or so other smaller islands. Guam is part of the Marianas, but it was controlled by America via a small, extraordinarily brave contingent of Marines until the start of the war. The Marshall Islands became known for the battles on Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Majuro -- they include about thirty other coral atolls located halfway between Australia and Hawaii. The Ryukyus, the island chain hanging south of the Japanese Home Islands and sweeping down to Okinawa, was the battleground of the kamikazes. The Bonins are most famous for a small island called Iwo Jima.</p><p>Perhaps the most salient factor in Japanese territorial acquisition was that the Japanese, who had a relatively small military, were able to accomplish so much with so little. Radical nationalists had developed a pattern of brutal, lightning attacks against enemy strong points, followed by aggressive territorial acquisition far exceeding anything they could reasonably be expected to acquire, much less to hold. After these initial gains, the Japanese would enter into peace negotiations, in which much of the original territory would be divested, though still leaving Japan with enormous new territories, "legitimized" by the new peace treaty.</p><p>The United States, through a combination of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressures, determined to end Japanese expansion in Asia and the Pacific. This conflict between America and Japan was intensified repeatedly in a series of diplomatic moves by both countries that eventually made war inevitable. Each time the Japanese increased their territorial expansi...</p></p><h2>Cloud of Sparrows</h2><p>Once in a great while a new novelist comes along who dazzles us with rare eloquence and humanity, with flawless storytelling and a unique understanding of another place and time. Takashi Matsuoka is just such a writer. <br><br>His magnificent new novel, set amid the violence and beauty of nineteenth-century Japan, takes us beyond the epic tradition of James Clavell&#x2019;s <b>Shogun</b> and into a majestic realm of samurai and geishas, ninjas and Zen masters. Brilliantly imagined, gloriously written, <b>Cloud of Sparrows</b> is at once a sweeping historical adventure and a love story of almost unbearable poignancy. It is storytelling on the grand scale from a novelist of astounding depth and grace.<br><br><b>Cloud of Sparrows<br><br></b>It is the dawn of the New Year, 1861. After two centuries of isolation, Japan has been forced to open its doors to the West, igniting a clash of cultures and generations. And as foreign ships threaten to rain destruction on the Shogun&#x2019;s castle in Edo, a small group of American missionaries has chosen this time to spread the word of their God. Among them, Emily Gibson, a woman seeking redemption from a tormented past, and Matthew Stark, a cold-eyed killer with one more death on his mind. <br><br>Neither realizes that their future in Japan has already been foreseen. For a young nobleman, Lord Genji, has dreamt that his life will be saved by an outsider in the New Year. Widely reviled as a dilettante, Lord Genji has one weapon with which to inspire awe. In his family, one in every generation is said to have the gift of prophecy. And what Lord Genji sees has struck fear in many around him. As the Shogun&#x2019;s secret police chief plots Genji&#x2019;s death--and the utter destruction of his entire clan--the young and untried lord must prove that he is more than the handsome womanizer of legend, famed lover of Edo&#x2019;s most celebrated geisha, Lady Heiko, and that his prophetic powers are no mere fairy tale. <br><br>Forced to escape from Edo and flee to his ancestral stronghold, the spectacular Cloud of Sparrows Castle, Genji joins his fate with Emily and Stark, unaware of the dark forces that drive them. Together with Genji&#x2019;s uncle, Lord Shigeru, a legendary swordsman knee-deep in the blood of his own kin, and the enigmatic Lady Heiko, the unlikely band embarks on a harrowing journey through a landscape bristling with danger--to prepare for a final battle.<br><br>Here, on a snowscape stained with blood, horror will mix with wonder, secrets will unravel, and love will duel with vengeance--as East and West, flesh and spirit, past and future, collide in ways no one--least of all Genji--could have imagined.</p><p>Following in the substantial footsteps of filmmaker Akiro Kurosawa and <i>Shogun</i> author James Clavell is Takashi Matsuoka, whose action-packed debut novel, <i>Cloud of Sparrows</i>, unfolds as the age of the samurai warrior starts to wane. The year is 1861, and Lord Genji of Akaoka, last in line of the Okamichi clan, welcomes missionaries Emily, Matthew, and Zephaniah to Japan. Cut off from the West for more than 2,000 years, Japan is as completely unprepared for these outsiders as the missionaries are for geishas and honor killings. Genji, his geisha love Heiko, and the missionaries suddenly find themselves in the middle of several nefarious plots to overthrow the Okamichi leader from as far away as the shogun's palace and as close as Genji's own henchmen. Genji and his visitors journey together across treacherous terrain to seek refuge at the faraway Cloud of Sparrows palace. Although it's a rip-roaring yarn full of ambushes, swordfights, cross-cultural friction, love, and prophetic visions, the book does read a bit like a screenplay, cutting quickly from one scene to another. But the frequent shifts in the story's tempo succeed in making the novel all the more vivid, allowing simultaneous action and contemplation to deepen the story and its inhabitants. <i>--Emily Russin</i>"The book seizes you from start to finish."<br>--<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>"Adventure-filled." <br>--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Plausible Denial: Was the CIA Involved in the Assassination of JFK?</h2><p>The follow-up to the author&#39;s best-selling Rush to Judgment, which criticized the Warren Commission&#39;s report on the Kennedy assassination, attempts to demonstrate that the CIA helped plan the president&#39;s murder.

Mark Lane&#39;s research on CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination is both convincing and disturbing. However, the performance proves impersonal and uninspired. Paul Soles places too much distance between himself and the material. The facts of this compelling subject are presented with little emotion.

Reprint.</p><p><b>Emilie Richards</b>'s many novels feature complex characterizations and in-depth explorations of social issues. Her training and experience as a family counselor contribute to her fascination with relationships of all kinds. <p>Emilie, the mother of four, lives in Arlington, Virginia, with her minister husband, just down the road from historic Georgetown.</p>Richards (Fox River) adds to the territory staked out by such authors as Barbara Delinsky and Kristin Hannah with her hardcover debut, an engrossing novel about rebuilding relationships after a betrayal. Faith Bronson, daughter of an overbearing U. S. senator and wife of a conservative family-values lobbyist, gets a shock when she stumbles upon her beloved husband with his male lover. After the development becomes public, the repercussions sweep away her sheltered life and profoundly affect her children, nine-year-old Alex and 14-year-old Remy, as well as her parents' marriage. Faith's new life begins when her mother gives her their old family home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., which is badly in need of repair. The house guards long-buried secrets: some sweet, some tragic and some pertaining to the unsolved kidnapping of Faith's older sister as an infant. While Faith attempts to come to terms with her family's past, she must rein in rebellious Remy, who's resentful of having to move to a new house and a new school, and deal with her attraction to Internet entrepreneur Pavel Quinn, a man with secrets of his own. Over the course of a year, Faith renovates the house and, in the process, lays down the foundation for her future. Richards's writing is unpretentious and effective ("She'd never had to think about what to say to her daughter. Now every word needed a rehearsal"), and her characters burst with vitality and authenticity despite a dose of sentimentality near the end. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Draw People in 15 Minutes: How to Get Started in Figure Drawing</h2><p><p>Yes, you can draw!

Al Sharpton</p><p>The modest size, slender girth, and bookish typeface of this little volume will effectively put off readers who are looking for glitzy peeks into the lifestyles of the rich and famous. The more sober readers who are the target audience of <i>New York Living Rooms</i> should get the irony at once, and for them this book will provide hours of voyeuristic pleasure. Dominique Nabokov is a realist. Her artfully deadpan color photographs, empty of people, simply show what is there to see, without obvious slant. And yet this collection of more than 100 Polaroids somehow invokes the mix of New Yorkers--wealthy, brilliant, witty, powerful, stylish, artistic, neurotic, and/or beautiful people--that makes the city what it is. It is fascinating, for example, to see what a warm, cozy, plant-filled living room the pompous, pompadoured Reverend Al Sharpton possesses. There is a posthumous, two-picture tour of Allen Ginsberg's poor but immaculate rooms; a shot of the magnificent Quentin Crisp's monkish cell; and pictures of the two-story living rooms of Elizabeth Hardwick and Barbara Epstein, whose shelves in their respective Hotel des Artists apartments still have space for more books. Wow. There are Bierre Berg�'s velvet-covered digs at the Pierre Hotel; Mario Buatta's gold-framed collection of springer spaniel portraits; Barbara Taylor Bradford's cold but tchotchke'd sitting room. In the end it is Nabokov's list--including former mayor Ed Koch, painter Louise Bourgeois, composer Philip Glass, Princess and Prince Alexander Romanoff, and Nabokov herself--that makes the book. These living rooms suggest the party of the century, if one could gather all the owners in one place.

Indian Summer is her first book.INDIAN SUMMER<br><i>Part One</i><i>Empire</i><i>1</i><i>In Their Gratitude Our Best Reward</i>IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WERE TWO NATIONS. ONE WAS A vast, mighty and magnificent empire, brilliantly organized and culturally unified, which dominated a massive swath of the earth. The other was an undeveloped, semifeudal realm, riven by religious factionalism and barely able to feed its illiterate, diseased and stinking masses. The first nation was India. The second was England.The year was 1577, and the Mogul emperors were in the process of uniting India. The domain spread twelve hundred miles along the Tropic of Cancer, from the eerie white salt flats of the Rann of Kutch on the shores of the Arabian Sea, to the verdant delta of the holy river Ganges in Bengal; and from the snowy crags of Kabul to the lush teak forests of the Vindhyan foothills. The 100 million people who lived under its aegis were cosmopolitan and affluent. In 1577, the average Indian peasant enjoyed a relatively higher income and lower taxation than his descendants ever would again. In the bazaars were sold gold from Jaipur, rubies from Burma, fine shawls from Kashmir, spices from the islands, opium from Bengal and dancing girls from Africa. Though governed by Muslims under a legal system based loosely on sharia law, its millions of non-Muslim subjects--Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists--were allowed freedom of conscience and custom.1This empire was ruled by the world's most powerful man, Akbar the Great. Akbar was one of the most successful military commandersof all time, a liberal philosopher of distinction and a generous patron of the arts. He lived in unmatched opulence at Fatehpur Sikri, in rooms done out in marble, sandalwood and mother-of-pearl, cooled by the gentle fanning of peacock feathers. His hobbies were discussing metaphysics, collecting emeralds, hunting with cheetahs and inventing religions; he had as his plaything the Koh-i-Noor diamond, a gigantic, glittering rock weighing over 186 carats, then almost twice its present size.2 His family came from Mongolia, and his court showed a strongly Persian influence. But Indians were accustomed to foreign rule. Since the death of the indigenous emperor Asoka in 232 B.C., large parts of the subcontinent had been conquered by Turks, Afghans, Persians and Tocharians, as well as by Mongols. During a long and dramatic life, Akbar himself conquered and ruled over an area the size of Europe.In England, meanwhile, most of the population of around two and a half million lived in a state of misery and impoverishment. Politically and religiously, the country had spent much of the sixteenth century at war with itself. Around 90 percent of the population lived in rural areas and worked on the land, going hungry during the frequent food shortages. They were prevented from moving into industry by the protectionist racket of guild entry fees. Begging was common, and the nation's ten thousand vagabonds were the terror of the land. The low standard of living endured by much of the population--two-fifths of which lived at subsistence levels--and squalid conditions in towns ensured that epidemics of disease were common. The Black Death still broke out periodically, as did pneumonia, smallpox, influenza and something unpleasant called "the sweat." Life expectancy stood at just thirty-eight years--less than modern Sudan, Afghanistan or the Congo, and about the same as Sierra Leone.3 The vast majority of the English people were illiterate and superstitious; the discontent of communities often boiled over into rioting and witch hunts.But by the 1570s, from the filthy soil of England, the first green shoots of a pleasant land were sprouting forth. The economy began to recover from years of inflation and political instability. Efforts were made by the queen, Elizabeth I, toward religious tolerance, and by her government toward forcing communities to take some responsibilityfor the poor. After years of cultural backwardness, London society began to aspire to refinement. "They be desirous of new-fangles," complained the Elizabethan writer Philip Stubbs; "praising things past, condemning things present, and coveting things to come; ambitious, proud, light-hearted, unstable, ready to be carried away by every blast of wind."4 In 1577, a blast of wind drove the English to a world beyond the borders of Europe. At the request of the queen, the pirate and explorer Francis Drake set sail from Plymouth to bother the Spanish fleet in the Pacific and thence to circumnavigate the globe.Drake was not the only man at the court of Elizabeth whose mind was improbably turning to world domination. In 1577, the philosopher, kabbalist and magus John Dee conjured up the first image of a "Brytish Impire." At the time, Dee's suggestion would have seemed fanciful, though very few Englishmen could have known enough about geopolitics to say so. Next to Akbar, Elizabeth was indeed a weak and feeble woman, with her dubious breeding, her squabbling and faction-ridden court, her cluttered and rickety palaces, and her grubby, unsophisticated, cold, dismal little kingdom. Nonetheless, the greater monarch generously agreed to humor her shabby emissaries at his fabulous court. They were overwhelmed: both Agra and Fatehpur Sikri were far larger than London and many times more wondrous. Ralph Fitch, a merchant, described gilded and silk-draped carriages pulled by miniature oxen, and roads lined with markets selling victuals and gemstones. "The King hath in Agra and Fatepore, as they do credibly report, a thousand Elephants, thirty thousand Horses, fourteen hundred tame Deer, eight hundred Concubines; such a store of Ounces, Tigers, Buffles, Cocks and Hawks that it is very strange to see," he wrote home.5 Fitch's eventual return with stories of riches undreamed of by the wondering English came at an apt moment in history. The mighty Spanish Armada had been defeated, and England was starting to feel confident and expansive. Fitch was swiftly made a governor of Elizabeth's Levant Company. It was the beginning of four centuries of intimacy and exchange, a love-hate relationship between India and Britain which would change the histories of both countries--and that of the whole world--beyond what even the magus Dee could have predicted.Twenty-three years later, in 1600, Elizabeth granted a charter to "The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies" for fifteen years. That expiry date was canceled by her heir, James I, giving the East India Company exclusive trading rights in perpetuity. The only caveat: if it failed to turn a profit for three consecutive years, it voided all its rights. Thus a beast was created whose only object was money. It would pursue this object with unprecedented success.Over the following sixty years, the East India Company men's adventures in diplomacy brought them close to the Mogul emperors and allowed them to gain precedence over their Dutch and Portuguese rivals. Despite their obvious superficial differences, the Indians and the British were to find that they shared many of the same values and tastes. Both societies functioned through rigid class structures, glorified in their strongly disciplined military cultures and nurtured a bluff, unemotional secularism among their upper classes. Both prized swaggering but ultimately gallant men and spirited but ultimately demure women. Both enjoyed a sturdy sense of their own long histories and continual ascendancy. Complicated codes of etiquette were vital to their interaction; hunting on horseback and team sports dominated their social lives. As time went on, they would even discover a shared taste for punctilious and obstructive bureaucracy.The British relationship with India would be of a different quality from those it had with its other colonies. India was always the "Jewel in the Crown"; the British found that they often respected, understood and liked the Indian people in a way that they did not on the whole respect, understand or like the Chinese, the Aborigines or the various tribes of Africa. The sympathy was so convincing that intermarriage between Britons and Indians became quite commonplace in the early years of the company. Many Britons emigrated permanently to India, where they set up home, started families and raised dynasties.6But the history of empire did not remain so cozy for long. After the English republic fell and the monarchy was restored, King Charles II would turn the East India Company into a monster. With five acts, he gave it an amazing array of rights without responsibilities. By the1670s, the company could mint its own coin, maintain its own army, wage war, make peace, acquire new territories and impose its own civil and criminal law--and all without any accountability, save to its shareholders. This was pure capitalism, unleashed for the first time in history. Combined with the gradual fragmentation of Mogul control, which had begun after Akbar's death in 1605, it would prove to be almost unstoppable.This private empire of money, unburdened by conscience, rampaged across Asia unfettered until the 1850s. Guided only by market forces, it was both incredibly successful and incredibly brutal. Adam Smith, the high priest of free trade and originator of the "invisible hand" theory of markets, was appalled by the result of a completely unregulated corporation. "The difference between the genius of the British constitution which protects and governs North America, and that of the mercantile company which oppresses and domineers in the East Indies, cannot perhaps be better illustrated than by the different state of those countries," he wrote in his 1776 classic, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>.7 The British government was beginning to agree, and over the following decades regulation began to creep in, act by act. Eventually, in 1834, the parliament in London decided that an empire based on trade was in poor taste, and drew up a new charter. The East India Company was still to govern, but no more to trade. Presenting the scheme to parliament, Thomas Babington Macaulay freely admitted that licensing out British sovereignty to a private company was inappropriate. "It is the strangest of all governments," he said, "but it is designed for the strangest of all empires."8 But the British Crown could not bring its beast to heel. That would take a revolt by the Indians themselves.In the century after Robert Clive's famous victory over the Nawab of Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the company had embarked upon a run of military enterprises. Its armies fought the Burmese twice, annexing Burma in 1852; the Afghans once; and the Sikhs twice, taking the entirety of the Punjab by 1849. They took Gwalior in 1844 and conquered Sind in 1843, Nagpur in 1853, and Oudh in 1856. By then, almost 70 percent of the subcontinent could be called British territory.9 There had been some efforts at improvingthe lot of the people of India, too, though not all of them were welcomed. Efforts were made to set up British schools in which Indians might be educated. Suttee, the burning of live Hindu widows on the funeral pyres of their dead husbands, was banned in 1829. The company also attempted to stamp out thuggee, a brutal lifestyle adopted by bands of professional thieves. The thugs were given to strangulation of their victims and devoted to Kali, the goddess of death. They were held responsible for many thousands of murders in the early nineteenth century.10 But this policymaking and interference, these wars and laws, finally drew the attention of the Indian people to the fact that they had been subjugated. Companies, it was thought, did not conquer, and therefore no threat had been detected. The Moguls had been lulled by the promise of ever greater riches and had invited the East India Company across their own threshold. Once inside, it had been able to suck the wealth and riches out of India and impose its own regime--all by the grace of the Indian rulers.11 "The English have not taken India," wrote Mohandas Gandhi succinctly in 1908; "we have given it to them."12There would be one great attempt to take it back by force, and that was the Indian Mutiny of 1857.13 Famously, the spark for the mutiny was the company's adoption of the Enfield rifle on behalf of its sepoys, the Indian soldiers serving in its army. The cartridges for this particular model were supplied in greased paper, which had to be bitten through before they were used. Rumors spread among the sepoys that the grease contained tallow derived from cow or pig fat, thereby offending both Hindus, who revered the cow, and Muslims, who were forbidden to eat the pig. It has never been proven whether the grease was actually objectionable, or whether the protests were opportunistically started by Indian agitators to damage the company.14Whatever the truth, the company made a public point of replacing its grease with a version made from ghee and beeswax; but this action came too late. The rumors had served their purpose. The scandal was the final insult in a catalog of British wrongs against the Indians. The conquest of states, the commandeering of private lands, the propping up of corrupt local landlords who used torture to extract revenues,the arbitrary imprisonments without trial, the evangelism of Christianity and the attacks on Indian cultural traditions--for not everyone had welcomed the outlawing of suttee--had pushed company dominance too far.15After several small-scale rebellions, the mutiny exploded with full force at the town of Meerut, just northeast of Delhi. On 24 April 1857, eighty-five troopers of the Third Light Cavalry had refused to use their cartridges. A court-martial composed of fifteen Indian officers found against the troopers on 8 May and sentenced them each to five to ten years' hard labor. The following day, two regiments at Meerut turned on their officers, sprung the eighty-five imprisoned sepoys from jail and pillaged the town. The English were shot, beaten to death, hacked at with swords, burned alive. Among the victims was a seven-year-old girl, her skull sliced in two by a single stroke from a blade; and pregnant twenty-three-year-old Charlotte Chambers, the fetus ripped out of her womb and dumped contemptuously on her breast.16By the morning of 11 May, the mutinous troops had marched south to Delhi and joined with a garrison there. The rebels took the Red Fort, home of the heir to the Mogul Empire, Bahadur Shah II. Bahadur Shah was a gentle and unimposing Muslim of eighty-one years of age. He occupied his hours with poetry and courtly etiquette, was said to believe rather eccentrically that he could transform himself into a gnat, and had no jurisdiction beyond the walls of the fort. He had been propped up and pensioned by the company, which found him useful in sustaining the illusion of Indian self-government. 17 The rebels seized on this reluctant and bewildered old man and convinced him that he ought to demand his long-lost power back.The restoration of the emperor, precarious though it was, suggested that there was a credible alternative to British private rule. As the news spread, uprisings surged across north and central India, agitating one-third of the subcontinent by mid-June. But India was a country of deep divisions, in which disparate factions had only been united by their opposition to foreign rule. Where the British were ejected, these factions were left to face the enormity of their differences.Meanwhile, the British retained the support of the Sikhs of the Punjab, the Pathans of the North-West Frontier, the Gurkhas of Nepal, and the armies of Bombay and Madras.

Her husband, Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan (1833&#x2013;1911), played a central role in some of the most significant civil rights decisions of his era, including his lone dissenting opinion in <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>, the infamous case that endorsed separate but equal segregation. And for fifty-seven years he was married to a woman who was busy making a mental record of their eventful lives.<br><br>After Justice Harlan&#x2019;s death in 1911, Malvina wrote <i>Some Memories of a Long Life, 1854&#x2013;1911</i>, as a testament to her husband&#x2019;s accomplishments and to her own. The memoir begins with Malvina, the daughter of passionate abolitionists, becoming the teenage bride of John Marshall Harlan, whose family owned more than a dozen slaves. Malvina depicts her life in antebellum Kentucky, and her courageous defense of the Harlan homestead during the Civil War. She writes of her husband&#x2019;s ascent in legal circles and his eventual appointment to the Supreme Court in 1877, where he was the author of opinions that continued to influence American race relations deep into the twentieth century. Yet <i>Some Memories</i> is more than a wife&#x2019;s account of a famous and powerful man.

It soon becomes clear that Tate really doesn't have a clue about Megan's life or her emotional reality, but the reader gets a fuller explanation from the girl's own perspective, and it's Megan, rather than her father, who turns out to be the real hero of this story. <p> Deaver draws the reader into the angry, rebellious Megan's desperate fight to save her own life in the creepy surroundings of a decrepit insane asylum in the Virginia mountains. (Deaver practically writes blueprints for the inevitable Hollywood set designer who will have a field day bringing the shuttered, rat-infested scene of Megan's captivity to the screen.) The motivation for Dr. Aaron Matthews's vendetta against the Colliers isn't revealed until most of the way through this crisply paced novel, but he's convincingly insane enough for it not to matter. Deaver throws a few implausible scenarios the reader's way, but they won't matter either; the chase is the thing.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.The dark, largely unknown, story of Blackwater, the world's most secretive, powerful, and fastest growing private army, is chillingly told in Jeremy Scahill's expos�. Fact by fact, Scahill demonstrates the widespread outsourcing of military tasks to private companies bankrolled by right-wing millionaire Eric Prince, the scion of a conservative dynasty (founded, ironically, on the invention of the lighted car visor and the car cup-holder). Tom Weiner has precise diction and a rumbling, authoritative delivery. Listeners might detect a slight jarring note when his masculine voice attempts women's voices, but nothing detracts from the saga of self-regulated profiteering armies being entrusted with U.S. foreign policy and U.S. lives.

Tour.</p><p>As it becomes increasingly associated with impressive corporate gains realized in recent years by companies ranging from FedEx and Rolex to Starbucks and Volvo, "branding" has developed into one of the marketing world's hottest concepts. And for good reason, contend well-known strategist Al Ries and his daughter Laura Ries in <i>The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding: How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand</i>.<p> "Marketing is building a brand in the mind of the prospect," they write. "If you can build a powerful brand you will have a powerful marketing program. If you can't, then all the advertising, fancy packaging, sales promotion and public relations in the world won't help you achieve your objective." A no-holds-barred look at a diverse collection of successful--and not-so-successful--branding efforts undertaken by these and other high-profile firms, their book distills the most critical principles involved into a series of clear rules with straightforward titles such as The Law of Expansion, The Law of Contraction, The Law of Consistency, and The Law of Mortality.

Henry, who began as a rookie in <i>The Southpaw</i> and developed into a pro in <i>Bang the Drum Slowly</i>, is a mature veteran in <i>A Ticket for a Seamstitch</i>.&nbsp;A seamstress from "somewhere out West" writes to Henry, her hero, that she will be in New York to watch the Mammoths play on the Fourth of July. When she arrives in New York, both the married Henry and his pal, the very unmarried Thurston "Piney" Woods, are at a loss as to what to do with their visitor. The two men finally do the decent thing: they take the seamstress to the automat for dinner.

As Grant pinned Lee to Petersburg and Richmond, the Confederacy&#x2019;s stubborn Army of Northern Virginia struggled against a relentless Union behemoth, with breathtaking valor and sacrifice on both sides.

In the first section, called "Native Origins," we hear the legends of the grandmothers' birth traditions in the Longhouse with the fire that must not go out, "the smell of wood smoke, sweat and the sharp-sweet odor of blood," and the whisper "Don't forget who you are." "Detroit Songs" sings stories of people in their own sweet, sad voices: "Daddy" talks about work - "it was every minute you thought about a job, about feedin' your family." In "Garnet Lee," Beth's maternal grandmother tells about a Kentucky mining town, housekeeping jobs, black lung, and mine explosions. "Terri," Beth's Chippewa/"Pollack," friend relates why she dresses up sexy to dance for tips in a lesbian bar on the weekends; "Danny" tells how he loved wearing dresses and why he had to kill himself; and "Mama" talks about taking care of "all those kids." The last selections, "Long Stories," describe two mothers living one hundred years apart whose children were stolen, and show us the life of a "half-breed" growing-up girl in Detroit.

Fairbanks, son of the screen's definitive swashbuckler and stepson of Mary Pickford, "America's Sweetheart," relates incidents that deeply affected him after his parents' divorce in 1917 when he was seven. There are stories about the author's famous friends (Olivier, Edward G. Robinson, Noel Coward, etc.) and lovers (Gertrude Lawrence, Marlene Dietrich and others), as well as a portrait of his first wife, Joan Crawford. It is particularly interesting to follow the steps related here in Fairbanks' career, starting in the silents of the 1920s (Stella Dallas) and continuing in the talkies that brought him starring roles in Little Caesar, The Prisoner of Zenda, Gunga Din and other epics of the 1930s. The book ends with the author's enlistment in the U.S. Navy in 1940 at age 30with the promise of a second volume that readers will welcome. Photos. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This first volume of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.'s autobiography (it recounts his life story through 1941) shows him to be virtually identical with his public persona. Fairbanks is a dandya witty, intelligent ladies' man (and sometimes a bit of a cad), with an avid craving to be one of the rich and famous. All but the most ardent Anglophile will be bored ultimately with the account of yet another country weekend with some lord and lady and hangers-on, but Fairbanks's story of his life in Hollywood more than compensates. He strikes a successful balance between candor and discretion in telling of his affairs (with Marlene Dietrich, among many others) and his early marriage to Joan Crawford.

InHouse Justice, an American defense contractor goes to Iran to sell missile technology, and the CIA knows all about it thanks to a spy in Tehran. But the story is leaked to an ambitious journalist and the spy is burned, brutally tortured, and executed.The director of the CIA isn&#x20ac;&#x2122;t about to let the callous sacrifice of his valuable spy go unpunished.

Enraged, the director of Central Intelligence blames the leak on Congress. Speaker of the House John Fitzpatrick Mahoney isn&#x2019;t sure who leaked the information, but he&#x2019;s certain the journalist, jailed for refusing to name her source, will spill the beans about their one-night stand 20 years earlier. Mahoney summons Joe DeMarco, his personal gumshoe and fixer, to identify the leaker and keep the journalist from embarrassing him. Lawson&#x2019;s tight, high-energy prose drives a plot with more turns than the Burma Road, as DeMarco finds himself surrounded by sleazy legislators, CIA spooks, Russian gangsters, FBI agents, assorted hit men, a misanthropic billionaire, a SoCal surfer/computer-gamer/millionaire, and a mysterious Iranian florist hell-bent on avenging the murdered spy. Some two dozen characters, major and minor, are introduced, and Lawson makes all of them memorable; whatever their background&#x2014;Congress, espionage, Russian organized crime, or American business&#x2014;they all behave exactly as their culture dictates they must. The dialogue is sharp, cynical, and often funny, but the book succeeds because of its characters. Readers may reasonably wonder if these twisted individuals and the bent cultures that animate them might be shaping our lives.

His goal is nothing less than to reorient ethics toward the individual. He deals with the most thorny questions in contemporary philosophy and offers new ideas about issues such as relativism, objectivity, and the possibility of ethical knowledge.</p><p>Bernard Williams was White&#39;s Professor of Moral Philosophy, Oxford, and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy, University of California at Berkeley.Who has not asked--if only when depressed--"How should I live, and how can I find out?" To read this book is to be taken through one of the most sophisticated discussions available of such questions by an engaging, skeptical, often wryly witty and extraordinarily subtle professional. (Ronald de Sousa <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Bernard Williams's book is better read not as an introduction to ethics, but as an attempt to take stock of the present state of the subject. As such, it is a splendid piece of work It illuminatingly maps the various tendencies and the difficulties which they encounter...Such stocktaking is much needed. Bernard Williams is probably the philosopher best placed to undertake it, and he has done it admirably.

The similarities among the killings has led to speculation that they are the work of a single killer. This book describes each murder in great detail, vividly profiling the victims, chronicling the various police efforts to solve the crimes, and considering a number of possible suspects. (One is arrested and convicted of two murders but turns out not to be the serial killer.) The unifying figure in this discursive account is psychologist John Philpin, whose deepening involvement in the case and empathetic attempts to create a psychological profile of the killer ultimately threatens his emotional security. While the chapters provide a series of involving narratives (the account of the one survivor is riveting), the fact that the case remains unsolved gives this book an unfocused and unfinished feel. In the end, The Shadow of Death is nothing more than a series of unanswered questions. For larger true crime collections. --Ben Harrison, East Orange P.L., N.J.<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the mid-1980s, six women were brutally stabbed to death by a serial murderer, still not caught, who roamed the Connecticut River valley bordering New Hampshire and Vermont. In this chronicle of the crimes and the FBI investigations, Ginsburg ( Poisoned Blood ) reports that several other murdered women may have been victimized by the same person. He also describes the experiences of a young woman who survived a violent assault, likely by the same killer. Focusing on the skills, tactics and personalities of the police and psychologists sifting through case evidence and leads, Ginsburg writes with keen appreciation of the region's backroads, rest stops, landscape and pace of life. He insightfully details the thorough investigation of several suspects who were eventually cleared of suspicion. Photos not seen by PW.

Was the killer one of Aurelius Chrysippus's stable of writers, dissatisfied with the patron's lack of enthusiasm for his latest opus or resentful about the humiliating terms of his contract? Or was Chrysippus's bloody death connected to financial shenanigans at the Aurelian Bank? Commissioned to investigate the murder by his friend Petronius Longus, Falco finds himself in the middle of a case with clues that may lie in the fragments of a manuscript found at the murder scene--or maybe in the banking records someone seems willing to kill to keep secret. At the same time, Falco's sorting out a thorny family matter concerning his mother and his sister, both of whom seem inordinately fond of an imperial spy Falco has good reason to distrust. And if that's not enough, he's also being taken to the cleaners by the contractors his wife Helena Justina has engaged to renovate their new home. <p> As usual, Davis brings first century Rome to glorious life, and subtly drives home the striking parallels between ancient and contemporary business, politics, and family life. In the 12th book of in this increasingly popular series, she makes the most of every opportunity for satire and spins a lively yarn guaranteed to make the reader laugh out loud and clamor for more. Fortunately, there's a solid backlist to entertain readers encountering Falco for the first time (<i>One Virgin Too Many</i>, <i>Two for the Lions</i>). <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Lindsey Davis lives in London, England.</p><h2>Real Presences</h2><p>Can there be major dimensions of a poem, a painting, a&nbsp;musical composition created in the absence of God? Or, is God always a real presence in the arts? Steiner passionately argues that a transcendent reality grounds all genuine art and human communication.<br><br>"A real tour de force. . . . All the virtues of the author's astounding intelligence and compelling rhetoric are evident from the first sentence onward."&#x2014;Anthony C. Yu, <i>Journal of Religion</i></p><p><b>George Steiner</b> has written&nbsp;a great many books during his&nbsp;long and distinguished career as a literary critic, essayist, philosopher, novelist, translator, and educator. He was professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva, Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative Literature and Fellow of St Anne's College at Oxford University, and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University.In this dense, prolix book, critic, linguist, novelist, polymath Steiner holds that in the creation of art (especially music), and in its experiencing, there is a fundamental encounter with a "real presence" and that, in fact, it is this transcendent reality that grounds all genuine art and human communication. He does not so much argue this in the traditional manner as give a "transcendental argument" a la Kant: since so much literature and so many literary figures attest to the thesis, it must be true. Because of its lack of discursive argument, this difficult book will be dissatisfying to philosophers and largely impenetrable to the general reader. But sophisticated readers looking for highly learned literary criticism will find much here to ponder.<br><i>- Leon H.

Born in 1909 to a wealthy family, the pseudonymous author, since "earliest childhood," was filled with "a horrible sense of dread at having such unmerited fortune." Convinced that he was "a child of bad karma and would die accordingly," he lived as a profligate, cajoling a monthly allowance from his family, indulging in a series of affairs that ended with double suicide attempts (which proved fatal to his partners), becoming addicted to morphine, drinking to excess--and all the while writing to critical acclaim. What makes Dazai's work so noteworthy is its confessional quality, particularly startling to his audience when he began publishing in 1933. His daring compensates for the defects here: like so many confessional writers, the author prides himself on his ability to wallow in remorse."To deceive others is to live in hell," he states, apparently feeling entitled to make this choice.

He explains that in the twentieth century, more large-scale public Japanese-style gardens were built outside of Japan than within; the bulk of these were built in North America, particularly along the Pacific coast. As Melba Levick's stunning color photographs show, the elements of these 20 gardens are stone lanterns, torii gates, arched and zigzag bridges, rocks, sand, ponds, and flowers. The gardens are in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. They range from the oldest, the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and the Japanese Friendship Garden at Balboa Park in San Diego, to those in private retreats and to those sponsored by universities and corporations. Each is explained in terms of its place in the evolution of the Japanese-style garden and the relation of its function to its design. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>The Fall of the House of Walworth: A Tale of Madness and Murder in Gilded Age America</h2><p><p>In the tradition of <i>The Devil in the White City</i> comes a spell-binding tale of madness and murder in a nineteenth century American dynasty</p><p>On June 3, 1873, a portly, fashionably dressed, middle-aged man calls the Sturtevant House and asks to see the tenant on the second floor.

She kept the curtains drawn by day, and most of the rooms she never entered after nightfall. </p><p>The house stood at the north end of Broadway, the celebrated main thoroughfare of the city of Saratoga Springs, New York. It was built in 1815 and acquired the name Pine Grove from the stand of pines that loomed over it. Back then its site was an outlying corner of a village just beginning to grow into a national showcase. The house grew larger along with the village. By the time Clara Grant Walworth was born in 1886, it had expanded extravagantly beyond its original dimensions and went by the name of the Walworth Mansion. </p><p>In 1952, as Clara contemplated the end of her days, the house was very much in the center, but of what? Saratoga Springs was a place she now found hard to recognize. The house was different too from what it had been in the time of her ancestor Chancellor Walworth. The protective pines were long gone, most of them cut down before her birth, the surrounding grounds sold off, and the original compact Walworth home obscured (as it changed from residence to court house to boarding school to hotel, reverting finally to residential seclusion) within the annexes and additional stories built around and on top of it. </p><p>The original one- and- a-half- story dwelling had been buried within the creaking hulk of a Victorian warren of tiny bedrooms and airless corridors. Within that warren Clara had spent her first months, her summers, and her holidays. Since turning fifty she had hardly left the place. </p><p>Outside, in the Saratoga Springs of the early 1950s, the old hotels&#x2014; those still standing&#x2014; were falling into decay. The decline had been steady for as long as Clara could remember. The symptoms were by now unmistakable. The splendors of Saratoga Springs were reduced to parking lots and orange- juice stands and neon- lit taverns, thronged with a new generation of tourists who knew nothing of the history that had taken shape here. At night cheap gamblers padded in bathrobes through the dark and narrow hallways of the once luxurious Grand Union Hotel. </p><p>The corruption of Saratoga was nowadays a national scandal. Local politicians and racket bosses submitted to federal investigation. The hearings were on television, so the whole world could see how thoroughly the town had been bought up, decades ago, by the likes of Arnold Rothstein and Joe Adonis and Meyer Lansky, gangsters in whose gaudy "lake houses" anything could happen. The townspeople had been happy to take the money and look the other way. </p><p>One way or another, this had been going on for years. You might say it had been going on ever since John Morrissey, a low- life Irish boxer from the back streets of Troy, had started up his gambling business during the Civil War. But the ruffians and vulgarians of Clara's parents' and grandparents' time began in retrospect to assume an air of respectability&#x2014; even dignity&#x2014; compared with the rot that had set in since. Morrissey, after all, had at least kept the locals out of his establishment, and shut down the gambling tables on Sundays. </p><p>She had lived to witness the final degradation of what had been not just beautiful but noble. The Saratoga Springs of racetracks and gambling dens was not the town Clara thought of as hers. Her Saratoga was an older, more rarefied place steeped in the memory of Revolutionary War heroes, inspired religious teachers, and women who had dedicated themselves for generations to preserving an America that seemed always on the verge of disappearing into some brutal caricature of itself. Her great- grandmother had been part of the effort to preserve George Washington's home at Mount Vernon; her grandmother had seen to it that the battlefield of Saratoga, where the tide of war had turned against the British, would endure as a historical monument; her mother had renovated this very house. </p><p>Why hadn't anyone stopped America from becoming a nation run by crooks? Not that there were not plenty of crooks in the old days, but forces also existed that were capable of holding them in check, forces as much spiritual as physical. There were things you didn't do, affronts that were unimaginable. Now it had all become a sort of affront. If she no longer enjoyed leaving the house, it was because some new shock always waited for her. One more thing had been destroyed or cheapened. </p><p>She preferred to stay indoors to savor what was preserved within the walls, even if most of it was invisible. Clara had been born in this house and, at sixty- five, could expect to die here. Her world was by now largely restricted to the innermost core, the Chancellor's original domain. It was a space thick with ghosts. She traced their movements by recollecting every story she had ever been told, every anecdote tied to the pictures and objects and pieces of old furniture for which the house had become a repository. By making sure that everything stayed in its place&#x2014; by remaining faithful to what her mother and grandmother had taught her&#x2014; she kept the ancestors near at hand. For years she had repeated the stories to any visitor who would listen. Now that visitors were rare, she told them to herself, taking care not to omit a single detail. </p><p>Her role, all her life, had been to preserve and remember. A votary in an abandoned temple, she had been born to go through every scrap of paper, rummage in every drawer, make lists of relics left behind. The house was her museum; her mausoleum, finally. She had been buried here, together with all she loved, for as long as she could remember. </p><p>She thought ceaselessly about everything that had happened in these rooms. Might it have been on this spot that Daniel Webster stood as he argued a case? Or in this corner that Andrew Jackson had exploded into wrath against the southern nullifiers, in the middle of a game of whist? James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving and the magnificent poet Mrs. Sigourney had sat at the dinner table. Presidents, senators, military commanders, the most distinguished authors, and the most celebrated preachers of the gospel, all had trooped through, in the time of heroes and founders when the world was fresh. </p><p>Here was the north parlor where the man those people came to see&#x2014; her great- grandfather, New York's state chancellor Reuben Hyde Walworth&#x2014; held court for decades. Now it had become her sickroom. </p><p>She had come to the end, not just of her own life, but of everything to which those earlier lives had been dedicated. </p><p>There had been a family and there had been a nation. To her they had almost been the same thing. She carried the blood of the <i>MayԨ�ower </i>pilgrims in her. Davy Crockett was somewhere in the family tree. Her mother's father had been a friend of President Lincoln, her paternal great- grandmother a cousin of Mary Todd. Her great- uncle had left his right arm on a battlefield in Virginia. Her grandmother had danced at President Grant's inauguration. On both sides of the family her people had warded off invading armies and established the laws of the new land. They had been among those who counted for something in the making of the country. Now that the family had almost reached, in her, its point of extinction, might not the country as well be close to its terminus? </p><p>And where had the family gone? How could a family vanish? </p><p>In the memory parade of ancestors&#x2014; the settlers and warriors and justices and evangelists&#x2014; something was missing. There was an episode never to be part of any inscription or memorial address. It lived in unlit corners. At times it made her feel she had really not been born, as if this half- life were a shadow cast by a disaster before her birth. </p><p>Her life had been, perhaps, an act of commemoration for a gigantic absence, for a missing father and a missing grandfather: the grandfather whose memory had been so thoroughly crossed out, and the father who died just seven months after her birth, exhausted before his time. Both were swallowed up in the same obscure storm. </p><p>It had been a long time before she was allowed to know why there was such a gaping hole in the family history. People had been good about not bringing up what was best forgotten. Recollections trailed off into silence. A day came when she realized how well she had been protected from the moment she was born. Everyone, starting with her mother, had shielded her as long as possible from information too jarring for her young mind. </p><p>They had almost succeeded in sweeping from the house all traces of quarrels and ravings, of murder and of judicial punishment that killed the soul if not the body. Around that blotted- out zone the pageants and observances&#x2014; meticulous rounds of a social protocol never abandoned even in extremity&#x2014; clustered like a form of healing. </p><p>The healing was also a concealing. Pieces of what had been left out were eventually to be found hidden in diaries, scrapbooks, letters, the old documents that her grandmother Ellen (she had written it in the diary that Clara inherited) had one night sat up reading, "stirring up the old miseries which have been dead for years." Of Clara's grandfather Mansfield Tracy Walworth, all that remained was a small shelf of books in matching format, bearing such incommunicative titles as <i>Warwick </i>and <i>Beverly </i>and <i>Lulu </i>and <i>Delaplaine</i>. They were novels whose opening paragraphs spoke of moaning winds and impenetrable gloom, bells tolling at midnight, ominously deserted metropolitan streets, cells in which unnamed prisoners were brutally punished. But their many hundreds of pages of clotted prose led only into strange impasses, spasmodic mood swings, hermetic interviews between people whose identities or intentions were never quite clear. </p><p>Concealed most carefully of all was the letter that Frank Walworth, the father whom Clara never knew, wrote ten days before his death. She read it many times in later years. It was as close as she could get to him. Each time it was as if she peered into a closed room in which someone was suffering horribly, and could do nothing to comfort him. Frank announced: </p><p>When you read this letter, the last of the Walworths of Saratoga Springs will have been laid to rest. And as I now face the "Great Beyond" in the full knowledge that the crime I committed thirteen years ago brought me to this early end, at thirty- three years, I pen this message with the sincere hope that the youth of the generation that reads it will have learned the lesson I failed to grasp. The wages of sin is death&#x2014; death to the soul and the body and the mind!... I today know the full meaning of that verse in Exodus: "I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generations."... </p><p>As I make ready to meet the Great Judge of All, I would say that the verdict of the jury rendered in my case was a just one... I have come to realize, that for the crime I committed, my wife and daughter would also pay the price. In very truth, the wages of sin is death. Keep that in mind, when as youth of another generation, you attempt to take the law into your own hands. May God help you to keep the ten commandments of God, which are the basic law of all life and love and living. </p><p>FRANK HARDIN WALWORTH </p><p><i>October 19, 1886. </i></p><p>"Unto the third and fourth generations"&#x2014; the family had not even gotten that far. Her father could not have foreseen that his only daughter would live out her life childless. With Clara's approaching end all these documents would pass beyond her control. Perhaps after her death a part of what had been so long wrapped up would be revealed, even if there remained the question of what exactly that revelation would amount to. Who, after all, was Frank Hardin Walworth, and what might her life have been if she had known the answer to that question? </p><p>In stretches of uninterrupted solitude she found herself tracing a path in a city strange to her, a city she had never dared to explore. Amid railroad smoke and avenues full of foul stenches and jostling anonymous crowds she followed the movements of two men&#x2014; the large and menacing older figure with blazing eyes and a boxer's build&#x2014; and, in his wake, the deceptively unemotional boy scarcely arrived at his full height, making his way through the clutter and noise as if oblivious to what was around him. </p><p>A stalker laid a trap and left messages. His designated target moved through the rounds of his hours oblivious that they were racing toward their close. </p><p>But who had really designed the trap? The whole city was a trap; time was a trap; the inward coiling of a family was a trap; each of the men was himself the trap in which he was caught. In those depots and eating houses and lobbies and stairways&#x2014; those unlit halls and sparsely furnished bedrooms&#x2014; no breeze entered. The immense city ground to a halt. She could not imagine a word being spoken. </p><p>One man approached the other, drawn to him as if sleepwalking. The sun had barely come up. In a moment, in a narrow room at the top of the stairs, they would meet face- to- face and her destiny would be written, or unwritten: erased by blood. </p></p><h2>Georges Seurat: The Drawings</h2><p>Once described as &#34;the most beautiful painter&#39;s drawings in existence,&#34; Georges Seurat&#39;s mysterious and luminous works on paper played a crucial role in his short, vibrant career. This comprehensive publication surveys the artist&#39;s entire oeuvre, from his academic training and the emergence of his unique methods to the studies made for his monumental canvases. Accompanying the first exhibition in almost 25 years to focus exclusively on Seurat&#39;s drawings, this volume presents approximately 130 works, primarily the artist&#39;s incomparable cont� drawings along with a small selection of oil sketches and paintings. In an effort to bridge the seemingly opposite goals of description and evocation, Seurat masses dark and light tones to abstract figures, exploits medium and paper to amplify radiating light, and engages with the Parisian metropolis, revealing urban types, the industrial suburbs and nineteenth-century entertainment. Though Seurat is perhaps best known as the inventor of Pointillism, this volume demonstrates his tremendous achievement as a draftsman and his fundamental importance to the art of the twentieth century. It includes carefully selected details of the work, as well as reproductions from pages of Seurat&#39;s sketchbooks, which have never before been published. Texts by Jodi Hauptman, Karl Buchberg, Hubert Damisch, Bridget Riley, Richard Shiff and Richard Thomson address specific aspects of Seurat&#39;s techniques, materials, and subject matter. They are rounded out by a chronology, a selected bibliography and a detailed checklist.</p><p></p><h2>The World of Odysseus: Second Edition</h2><p>Examines the values, social structure, ethics, and cultural achievements of the society that formed the background of Homer&#39;s epics</p><p><b>M. I. Finley</b> (1912-1986), the son of Nathan Finkelstein and Anna Katzellenbogen, was born in New York City. He graduated from Syracuse University at the age of fifteen and received an MA in public law from Columbia, before turning to the study of ancient history. During the thirties, Finley taught at Columbia and City College and developed an interest in the sociology of the ancient world that was shaped in part by his association with members of the Frankfurt School who were working in exile in America. In 1952, when he was teaching at Rutgers, Finley was summoned before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and asked whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. He refused to answer, invoking the Fifth Amendment; by the end of the year he had been fired from the university by a unanimous vote of its trustees. Unable to find work in the US, Finley moved to England, where he taught for many years at Cambridge, helping to redirect the focus of classical education from a narrow emphasis on philology to a wider concern with culture, economics, and society. He became a British subject in 1962 and was knighted in 1979.

Bilton and Sim (Women at War, 1982)--who co-produced an Emmy-winning TV-documentary on My Lai--begin by speaking with Varnardo Simpson, gunner with Charlie Company, 1969; for 20 years he has imprisoned himself in a tiny shack, tortured by memories. Through extraordinary research, the authors go on to discover the sad fates of several of Simpson's fellow vets; talk with Vietnamese survivors of the bloodbath; reveal facts cloaked by the Army's court-martial system; expose White House machinations to obscure ``a grave breach'' of the 1949 Geneva Convention; and document a coverup involving dozens of officers right up to the rank of major general. Only one soldier was court-martialed for the massacre: Lt. William Calley. And, as the authors explain, initial public outrage gave way, apparently as the result of manipulations by Richard Nixon, to the sentiment that Calley was a martyr: When the soldier was convicted of premeditated murder, Nixon ordered him released from Leavenworth. By the authors' account, there was only one hero at My Lai: young helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson. Seeing Charlie Company driving children to the killing ditch, Thompson landed in front of troops, trained his machine guns on them, and rescued the children. In a supreme irony, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross: his sound judgment ``had greatly enhanced Vietnamese-American relations in the operational area.'' Thompson threw the decoration away. Savagery, the authors declare, has been endemic to every American conflict: in 1902, US troops in the Philippines slaughtered ``goo-goos'' indiscriminately; in WW II, soldiers sent their girlfriends Japanese skulls. But why is it continually repeated? ``Massacre has a short shelf life,'' say Bilton and Sim. Essential for the war scholar's bookshelf; for the generalist, a profoundly moving human document.

A bestseller in England, there's even a little high-toned erotica thrown into the mix to convince the doubtful. The book's hero, a 20-year-old Englishman named Stephen Wraysford, finds his true love on a trip to Amiens in 1910. Unfortunately, she's already married, the wife of a wealthy textile baron. Wrayford convinces her to leave a life of passionless comfort to be at his side, but things do not turn out according to plan. Wraysford is haunted by this doomed affair and carries it with him into the trenches of World War I. <i>Birdsong</i> derives most of its power from its descriptions of mud and blood, and Wraysford's attempt to retain a scrap of humanity while surrounded by it. There is a simultaneous description of his present-day granddaughter's quest to read his diaries, which is designed to give some sense of perspective; this device is only somewhat successful.

Wentwovth,&#34; this exquisitely funny journal charts the tribulations of an earnest but gullible school master.</p><p>Close to retirement, A.J. Wentworth, though well-intentioned, is a humorless and ineffective educator of the old school. Despite an unshakable faith in his own methods, he is ill-equipped to deal with the devious vagaries of the modern schoolboy. While he fusses over trivialities and worries over rules, the pupils of Set IIIA run riotous circles around him. Nor are his fellow masters above exploiting his gullibility and pomposity for their own amusement. As if this wasn&#39;t enough, Wentworth is prone to more than the odd accident--mishaps that inevitably lead him into all sorts of hot water. Yet Wentworth is determined to hold his head high and live in cheerful denial of the absurd hand life seems to have dealt him. A deadpan classic of English humor.

The tragedy of Irish civil war gives way in the 1920s to a repressive Catholic state led by Eamon De Valera. Married women cannot hold jobs, divorce is illegal, and the IRA has become a band of outlaws still devoted to and fighting for a Republic that never lived. The Great Depression stalks the world, and war is always on the horizon, whether in Northern Ireland, Spain, or elsewhere on the European continent.</p><p>Ursula works for the fledgling Irish radio service and then for the League of Nations, while her personal life is torn between two men: an Irish civil servant and an English pilot.</p><p>Defying Church and State, Ursula bears a child out of wedlock, though she must leave the country to do so, and nearly loses her life in the opening days of World War II. Eventually she returns to an Ireland that is steadfastly determined to remain neutral during the war.</p><p><i>1949 </i>is the story of one strong woman who lives through the progress of Ireland from a broken land to the beginnings of a modern independent state.</p><p><b>The Irish Century Novels</b><br>1916: A Novel of the Irish Rebellion<br>1921: The Great Novel of the Irish Civil War<br>1949: A Novel of the Irish Free State<br>1972: A Novel of Ireland's Unfinished Revolution<br>1999: A Novel of the Celtic Tiger and the Search for Peace</p></p><p><p>"<i>1949</i> is gorgeously conceived and born, full of emotion, resonating with history and fresh as tomorrow."-- Parke Godwin</p><p><i>1949 </i>tells the story of Ireland's progress as seen through the eyes of one woman, from the bitter aftermath of civil war to the controversial dawn of a modern state. Ursula Halloran, the daughter of a famous revolutionary, comes of age in the turbulent 1920s. An education in Switzerland broadens her world view, but Ireland has become a repressive Catholic state where women are second-class citizens. Married women cannot hold jobs and divorce is illegal.</p><p>Fighting against the stifling constraints of church and state, Ursula forges an exciting career in the fledgling Irish radio service. Her life is torn apart when she finds herself caught between two men who love her in very different ways. Refusing to surrender her hard-won independence to marriage, or her illegitimate infant to an orphanage, she flees to Europe to bear her child. There she takes a job with the League of Nations and is caught up in the terrifying outbreak of World War II. Hard decisions and desperate situations stand between her and any hope of returning to the land she loves.</p><p>"Magisterial ... vivid ... richly gratifying." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>Since 1980, <b>Morgan Llywelyn</b> has created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, from the earliest times to the present day.

He lives in Virginia and Mississippi.CHAPTER 1<br><br>I am a lawyer, and I am in prison. It's a long story.<br><br>I'm forty-three years old and halfway through a ten-year sentence handed down by a weak and sanctimonious federal judge in Washington, D.C. All of my appeals have run their course, and there is no procedure, mechanism, obscure statute, technicality, loophole, or Hail Mary left in my thoroughly depleted arsenal. I have nothing. Because I know the law, I could do what some inmates do and clog up the courts with stacks of worthless motions and writs and other junk filings, but none of this would help my cause. Nothing will help my cause. The reality is that I have no hope of getting out for five more years, save for a few lousy weeks chopped off at the end for good behavior, and my behavior has been exemplary.<br><br>I shouldn't call myself a lawyer, because technically I am not. The Virginia State Bar swept in and yanked my license shortly after I was convicted. The language is right there in black and white--a felony conviction equals disbarment. I was stripped of my license, and my disciplinary troubles were duly reported in the Virginia Lawyer Register. Three of us were disbarred that month, which is about average.<br><br>However, in my little world, I am known as a jailhouse lawyer and as such spend several hours each day helping my fellow inmates with their legal problems. I study their appeals and file motions. I prepare simple wills and an occasional land deed. I review contracts for some of the white-collar guys. I have sued the government for legitimate complaints but never for ones I consider frivolous. And there are a lot of divorces.<br><br>Eight months and six days after I began my time, I received a thick envelope. Prisoners crave mail, but this was one package I could have done without. It was from a law firm in Fairfax, Virginia, one that represented my wife, who, surprisingly, wanted a divorce. In a matter of weeks, Dionne had gone from being a supportive wife, dug in for the long haul, to a fleeing victim who desperately wanted out. I couldn't believe it. I read the papers in absolute shock, my knees rubbery and my eyes wet, and when I was afraid I might start crying, I hustled back to my cell for some privacy. There are a lot of tears in prison, but they are always hidden.<br><br>When I left home, Bo was six years old. He was our only child, but we were planning more. The math is easy, and I've done it a million times. He'll be sixteen when I get out, a fully grown teenager, and I will have missed ten of the most precious years a father and son can have. Until they are about twelve years old, little boys worship their fathers and believe they can do no wrong. I coached Bo in T-ball and youth soccer, and he followed me around like a puppy. We fished and camped, and he sometimes went to my office with me on Saturday mornings, after a boys-only breakfast. He was my world, and trying to explain to him that I was going away for a long time broke both our hearts. Once behind bars, I refused to allow him to visit me. As much as I wanted to squeeze him, I could not stand the thought of that little boy seeing his father incarcerated.<br><br>It is virtually impossible to fight a divorce when you're in prison and not getting out soon. Our assets, never much to begin with, were depleted after an eighteen-month pounding by the federal government. We had lost everything but our child and our commitment to each other. The child was a rock; the commitment bit the dust. Dionne made some beautiful promises about persevering and toughing it out, but once I was gone, reality set in. She felt lonely and isolated in our small town. "People see me and they whisper," she wrote in one of her first letters. "I'm so lonely," she whined in another. It wasn't long before the letters became noticeably shorter and further apart. As did the visits.<br><br>Dionne grew up in Philadelphia and never warmed to life in the country. When an uncle offered her a job, she was suddenly in a hurry to go home. She remarried two years ago, and Bo, now eleven, is being coached by another father. My last twenty letters to my son went unanswered. I'm sure he never saw them.<br><br>I often wonder if I will see him again. I think I will make the effort, though I vacillate on this. How do you confront a child you love so much it hurts but who will not recognize you? We are never going to live together again as a typical father and son. Would it be fair to Bo to have his long-lost father reappear and insist on becoming part of his life?<br><br>I have far too much time to think about this.<br><br>I am inmate number 44861-127 at the Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland. A "camp" is a low-security facility for those of us who are deemed nonviolent and sentenced to ten years or less. For reasons that were never made clear, my first twenty-two months were spent at a medium-security joint near Louisville, Kentucky. In the endless alphabet muck of bureau-speak, it is known as an FCI--Federal Correctional Institution--and it was a far different place than my camp at Frostburg. An FCI is for violent men sentenced to more than ten years. Life there is much tougher, though I survived without being physically assaulted. Being a former Marine helped immensely.<br><br>As far as prisons go, a camp is a resort. There are no walls, fences, razor wire, or lookout towers and only a few guards with guns. Frostburg is relatively new, and its facilities are nicer than most public high schools. And why not? In the United States we spend $40,000 a year to incarcerate each prison inmate and $8,000 to educate each elementary school student. Here we have counselors, managers, caseworkers, nurses, secretaries, assistants of many varieties, and dozens of administrators who would be hard-pressed to truthfully explain how they fill their eight hours each day. It is, after all, the federal government. The employee parking lot near the front entrance is packed with nice cars and trucks.<br><br>There are six hundred inmates here at Frostburg, and, with a few exceptions, we are a well-behaved group of men. Those with violent pasts have learned their lessons and appreciate their civilized surroundings. Those who've spent their lives in prison have finally found the best home. Many of these career boys do not want to leave. They are thoroughly institutionalized and cannot function on the outside. A warm bed, three meals a day, health care--how could they possibly top this out there on the streets?<br><br>I'm not implying this is a pleasant place. It is not. There are many men like me who never dreamed they would one day fall so hard. Men with professions, careers, businesses; men with assets and nice families and country-club memberships. In my White Gang there is Carl, an optometrist who tinkered too much with his Medicare billings; and Kermit, a land speculator who double and triple pledged the same properties to various banks; and Wesley, a former Pennsylvania state senator who took a bribe; and Mark, a small-town mortgage lender who cut some corners.<br><br>Carl, Kermit, Wesley, and Mark. All white, average age of fifty-one. All admit their guilt.<br><br>Then there's me. Malcolm Bannister, black, aged forty-three, convicted of a crime I had no knowledge of committing.<br><br>At this moment, at Frostburg, I happen to be the only black guy serving time for a white-collar crime. Some distinction.<br><br>In my Black Gang, the membership is not so clearly defined. Most are kids from the streets of D.C. and Baltimore who were busted for drug-related crimes, and when they are paroled, they will return to the streets with a 20 percent chance of avoiding another conviction. With no education, no skills, and a criminal record, how are they supposed to succeed?<br><br>In reality, there are no gangs in a federal camp and no violence. If you fight or threaten someone, they'll yank you out of here and send you to a place that's far worse. There is a lot of bickering, mainly over the television, but I have yet to see someone throw a punch. Some of these guys have served time in state prisons, and the stories they tell are horrifying. No one wants to trade this place for another joint.<br><br>So we behave as we count the days. For the white-collar guys, the punishment is humiliation and the loss of status, standing, a lifestyle. For the black guys, life in a camp is safer than where they came from and where they're going. Their punishment is another notch on their criminal records, another step in becoming career felons.<br><br>Because of this, I feel more white than black.<br><br>There are two other ex-lawyers here at Frostburg. Ron Napoli was a flamboyant criminal lawyer in Philadelphia for many years, until cocaine ruined him. He specialized in drug law and represented many of the top dealers and traffickers in the mid-Atlantic region, from New Jersey to the Carolinas. He preferred to get paid in cash and coke and eventually lost everything. The IRS nailed him for tax evasion, and he's about halfway through a nine-year sentence. Ron's not doing too well these days. He seems depressed and will not, under any circumstances, exercise and try to take care of himself. He's getting heavier, slower, crankier, and sicker. He used to tell fascinating stories about his clients and their adventures in narco-trafficking, but now he just sits in the yard, eating bag after bag of Fritos and looking lost. Someone is sending him money, and he spends most of it on junk food.<br><br>The third ex-lawyer is a Washington shark named Amos Kapp, a longtime insider and shifty operator who spent a career slinking around the edges of every major political scandal. Kapp and I were tried together, convicted together, and sentenced ten years apiece by the same judge. There were eight defendants--seven from Washington and me. Kapp has always been guilty of something, and he was certainly guilty in the eyes of our jurors. Kapp, though, knew then and knows now that I had nothing to do with the conspiracy, but he was too much of a coward and a crook to say anything. Violence is strictly prohibited at Frostburg, but give me five minutes with Amos Kapp and his neck would be broken. He knows this, and I suspect he told the warden a long time ago. They keep him on the west campus, as far away from my pod as possible.<br><br>Of the three lawyers, I'm the only one willing to help other inmates with their legal problems. I enjoy the work. It's challenging and keeps me busy. It also keeps my legal skills sharp, though I doubt if I have much of a future as a lawyer. I can apply for reinstatement to the bar when I'm out, but that can be an arduous procedure. The truth is I never made any money as a lawyer. I was a small-town practitioner, black on top of that, and few clients could pay a decent fee. There were dozens of other lawyers packed along Braddock Street scrambling for the same clients; the competition was rough. I'm not sure what I'll do when this is over, but I have serious doubts about resuming a legal career.<br><br>I'll be forty-eight, single, and in good health, hopefully.<br><br>Five years is an eternity. Every day I take a long walk, alone, on a dirt jogging trail that skirts the edges of the camp and follows the boundary, or the "line," as it is known. Step over the line, and you're considered an escapee. In spite of being the site of a prison, this is beautiful country with spectacular views. As I walk and gaze at the rolling hills in the distance, I fight the urge to just keep walking, to step over the line. There is no fence to stop me, no guard to yell my name. I could disappear into the dense woods, then disappear forever.<br><br>I wish there was a wall, one ten feet tall, made of solid brick, with coils of glistening razor wire along its top, one that would keep me from gazing at the hills and dreaming of freedom. This is a prison, damn it! We can't leave. Put up a wall and stop tempting us.<br><br>The temptation is always there, and, as much as I fight it, I swear it's getting stronger by the day.<br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>Frostburg is a few miles west of the town of Cumberland, Maryland, in the middle of a sliver of land that is dwarfed by Pennsylvania to the north and West Virginia to the west and south. Looking at a map, it is obvious this exiled part of the state was the result of a bad survey and shouldn't belong to Maryland at all, though it's not clear who should have ownership. I work in the library, and on the wall above my little desk is a large map of America. I spend too much time gazing at it, daydreaming, wondering how I came to be a federal prisoner in a remote part of far-western Maryland.<br><br>Sixty miles south of here is the town of Winchester, Virginia, population twenty-five thousand, the place of my birth, childhood, education, career, and, eventually, The Fall. I am told that little has changed there since I left. The law firm of Copeland &amp; Reed is still doing business in the same storefront shop where I once worked. It's on Braddock Street, in the Old Town, next door to a diner. The name, painted in black on the window, was once Copeland, Reed &amp; Bannister, and it was the only all-black law firm within a hundred miles. I'm told that Mr. Copeland and Mr. Reed are doing well, certainly not prospering or getting rich, but generating enough business to pay their two secretaries and the rent. That's about all we did when I was a partner there--just manage to scrape by. At the time of The Fall, I was having serious second thoughts about surviving in such a small town.<br><br>I am told that Mr. Copeland and Mr. Reed refuse to discuss me and my problems. They came within an inch of being indicted too, and their reputations were tarnished. The U.S. Attorney who nailed me was blasting buckshot at anyone remotely connected to his grand conspiracy, and he almost wiped out the entire firm. My crime was picking the wrong client. My two former partners have never committed a crime. On so many levels I regret what has happened, but the slander of their good names still keeps me awake. They are both in their late sixties, and in their younger days as lawyers they struggled not only with the challenge of keeping a small-town general practice afloat but also fought some of the last battles of the Jim Crow era. Judges sometimes ignored them in court and ruled against them for no sound legal reason. Other lawyers were often rude and unprofessional. The county bar association did not invite them to join. Clerks sometimes lost their filings. All-white juries did not believe them. Worst of all, clients did not hire them. Black clients.

She's going to be the flower girl. That means she'll wear a celery dress and walk down the aisle with the ring bear, leading the way for the happy bride and groom.

Emma also learns that she is going to walk down the aisle with someone named Jacob who is the ring bear[er]. In the spirit of Amelia Bedelia, Emma imagines these things literally, and is surprised to find out that she&#x2019;s not going to dress up like a flower, or wear a frock made out of celery, or walk down the aisle with a bear. But the biggest surprise is when she meets Hannah&#x2019;s intended, a woman named Alex. The fact that there are two brides is unexpected, yet the beauty of this book is how quickly that knowledge normalizes into tradition. The wedding takes place in a synagogue under a chuppah, where the female rabbi reads the ketubah and says the seven wedding blessings. Hannah and Alex both stomp on wine glasses at the end of the ceremony and are carried around the dance floor on chairs. By framing same sex marriage as just another assumption to be disabused, the whole book maintains a light and celebratory tone as befits a book about families gathering to celebrate a simcha.

He is the London Evening Standard's drink correspondent and contributes to a number of wine publications and websites. He presents on BBC Radio 4 and has written a range of books on wine. Andrew has received a multitude of awards, including Glenfiddich Wine Writer of the Year, International Wine &amp; Spirit Communicator of the Year, and Glenfiddich Radio Broadcast of the Year. He lives in Hastings. Jason Lowe travels the world extensively photographing a number of subjects.

Jason works with Simon Hopkinson on the Saturday Independent, for which he won the 2001 Glenfiddich award for food photography. He also contributes to a range of international publications.This comprehensive wine atlas leaves no centimeter of terroir unexplored. After a thorough introduction to France, French winemaking and the concept of terroir, Jefford (Wine Tastes Wine Styles) gets to the heart of the matter with lengthy chapters on each of France's 14 regions. Each of these consists of an overview of the region and its history, profiles of the area's major winemakers, a description of the land and listings and descriptions of the local wineries. Some of the latter are lengthy, while others are brief, but all include an address and phone number, making this book useful as a guidebook as well. Jefford is refreshingly opinionated: the Loire Valley is in the throes of a "long and refined stone age," while Zind-Humbrecht in Alsace is the domain "most emblematic of the New France as a whole." The effort here is encyclopedic, but the writing rises above the usual dry discussion, comparing the quest to understand Burgundy to doing crossword puzzles. Even the most matter-of-fact information is presented with a certain flair: in a description of the Rhone Valley, Jefford explains that the area's mistral wind is both destructive and useful, in that it blows away "fugs and fungal diseases." Numerous maps and photographs-including portraits of the winemakers profiled-and a full list of vintages round out this entertaining addition to its field.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mercy Falls</h2><p>Responding to a domestic disturbance call on the Ojibwe reservation, Tamarack County sheriff Cork O&#39;Connor barely escapes a sniper attack and stumbles into the investigation of a Chicago businessman&#39;s murder, a dual case that is complicated by an attractive security consultant and Cork&#39;s rival half-brother.

A huge pillow that smelled faintly of lavender cradled her head. She was too warm and drew back the covers so that she lay exposed on the white sheet like a delicacy on a china plate. </p><p> She tried to sit up, far too quickly, and the room spun. A minute later, she tried again, this time rising gradually until she could see the whole of the great bedroom. The bed itself was a four-poster with a canopy. The armoire a few feet distant was the color of maple syrup and carved with ornate scrolling. On the walls, in elegant, gilt-edged frames, hung oil paintings of Mediterranean scenes, mostly with boats and angry, blue-black seas. The magnificent red of the Persian rug matched the thick drapes drawn back to let in the morning light. None of this was familiar to her. But there was one detail that struck a welcome chord: an explosion of daisies in a yellow vase on the vanity. Daisies, she remembered, had always been her favorite flowers. </p><p> A clean, white terry cloth robe had been neatly laid out at the foot of the bed, but she ignored it. She walked to the daisies and touched one of the blossoms. Something about the fragility of the petals touched her in return and made her sad in a way that felt like grieving. </p><p> For whom? she wondered, trying to nudge aside the veil that, at the moment, hung between her perception and all her understanding. Then a thought occurred to her. The birds. Maybe that was it. She was grieving for all the dead birds. </p><p> Her eyes lifted to the vanity mirror. In the reflection there, she saw the bruises on her body. One on her left breast above her nipple, another on the inside of her right thigh, oval-shaped, both of them, looking very much like the blue ghosts of tooth marks. </p><p> As she reached down and gingerly touched the tender skin, she heard firecrackers go off outside her window, two of them. Only two? she thought. What kind of celebration was that? </p><p> She put on the robe, went to the door, and opened it. Stepping out, she found herself in a long hallway with closed doors on either side, her only companions several tall standing plants that were spaced between the rooms like mute guardians. At each end of the hall, leaded windows with beveled glass let in enough daylight to give the emptiness a sense of benign well-being that she somehow knew was false. She crept down the hallway, listening for the slightest sound, feeling the deep nap of the carpet crush under the soles of her bare feet. At last she reached a staircase that wound to the lower level. She followed the lazy spiral unsteadily, her hand holding to the railing for balance, leaving moist fingerprints on the polished wood that vanished a moment after her passing. </p><p> She stood at the bottom of the stairway, uncertain which way to turn. To her right, a large room with a baby grand piano at its center, a brick fireplace, a sofa and loveseat of chocolate brown leather. To her left, a dining room with a huge crystal chandelier and a table large enough for a banquet. Sunlight from a long window cleaved the table, and in the bright gleam sat another vase full of daisies. Drawn by the smell of freshly brewed coffee, she moved through the dining room to the opened door of the kitchen beyond. </p><p> A carafe of orange juice sat on the counter near the sink, and next to it a glass, poured and waiting. The smell of the coffee came from a French-press coffeemaker that sat on a large butcher-block island. An empty cup and saucer had been placed on the block, as if she were expected. A book lay there, too, opened to a page that began, <i>I couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly in the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams.</i> </p><p> The sliding glass door that overlooked the veranda was drawn back, letting in the morning air, and she walked across the cool black and white kitchen tiles to the doorway. From there, she could see the back of the estate with its pool set into the lawn like a piece of cut turquoise. Beyond was the blue-gray sweep of a great body of water that collided at the horizon with a cornflower sky. Beside the pool stood a man in a yellow windbreaker with the hood pulled up. Although she couldn't see his face, there was something familiar in his stance. She stepped outside, not bothering to slide the door closed behind her. </p><p> It was a chilly morning. The cold marble of the veranda made her feet ache, but she paid no attention, because something else had caught her eye. A crimson billow staining the blue water. She descended the steps and followed a limestone walk to the apron of the pool. </p><p> The body lay on the bottom, except for the arms, which floated free, lifted slightly as if in supplication. The swimming trunks were white, the skin tanned. She couldn't see the wounds, only the blood that leaked from somewhere underneath, gradually tinting the turquoise water a deep rose. </p><p> The standing man turned his head slowly, as if it were difficult, painful even, for him to look away from death. The sun was at his back, his face shadowed, a gun in his hand. </p><p> She recognized him, and the thought of what he'd just done pulled her heart out of her chest. </p><p> "Oh, Cork, no," she whispered. </p><p> When he heard his name, his hard, dark eyes grew soft. Corcoran O'Connor stared at his wife, at her clean robe, her bare feet, her hair still mussed from a night she barely remembered. </p><p> "Jo," he said, "I came to bring you home."</p><p> Copyright � 2005 by William Kent Krueger </p><p><b></b></p><p><b> 1 </b> </p><p> They hit the skunk just outside of town, and after that, they drove with the windows down. It didn't help much. </p><p> "I know what you're thinking," Deputy Marsha Dross said. </p><p> "How could you know what I'm thinking?" Cork replied. </p><p> "Because it's what I'd be thinking if I were you." </p><p> "And what's that?" </p><p> "That if I'd let you drive, this wouldn't have happened." </p><p> "You're not me," Cork said. "And that's not what I'm thinking." </p><p> "What are you thinking?" </p><p> "Just wondering if there's enough money in the budget for a new Land Cruiser." He put his head out the window and let the air clear his nose. </p><p> The road they were traveling had been traveled before by generations of Ojibwe and Voyageurs. It connected the Blueberry River with Iron Lake and had been an important passage in the days of the fur trade. The French had called it Portage du Myrtille, Blueberry Portage. To the Ojibwe, whom the white men often called Chippewa but who preferred the name Anishinaabe, which meant Original People, it was known as Maanadamon -- Bad Trail -- because it was a long portage with stretches of marsh and deep mud. And skunks. To the engineers who, in the mid twentieth century, had widened and graded it and laid down asphalt, it was called simply County Road 23. They'd killed the beauty of the names, but they hadn't been able to destroy the stunning grandeur of the land through which it ran, the great Northwoods of Minnesota. </p><p> The asphalt ended at the beginning of the Iron Lake Reservation. On the rez, the wide shoulders disappeared and the road became a narrow gravel track following a clear stream that threaded its way through vast stands of pine and rugged hills topped with birch trees and spruce. </p><p> As Dross slowed down, the skunk smell grew worse. </p><p> "Maybe I should take it through a creek or something," she suggested. </p><p> "With skunk, I think you just have to let it wear off. Maybe we'll put this unit out to pasture for a while." He scanned the road in front of them, looking for the turn he knew was coming up. </p><p> Autumn had started out cold that year. The sugar maples and sumac had turned early, a deep crimson. At sunrise, the eastern sky was often the color of an open wound and sometimes on crisp mornings the frost that lay over everything reflected the sky, and the whole land appeared to bleed. Warm weather returned in the first week of October, and for the past few days it had felt almost like June again. </p><p> "I love Indian summer." Marsha Dross smiled, as if hoping for a pleasant change of subject. </p><p> She was a tall woman, nearly six feet, and slender. Her hair was coarse and brown and she kept it short. She had a broad face, large nose. In her uniform and without makeup -- something she never wore on the job -- she was sometimes mistaken for a man. Off duty, she knew what to do with mascara and eyeliner and lip gloss. She preferred tight dresses with high hemlines, gold jewelry, and line dancing. </p><p> "Don't you love Indian summer, Cork?" </p><p> "Know where the term <i>Indian summer</i> comes from?" he asked. </p><p> "No." </p><p> "A white man's phrase. They didn't trust Indians, so when the warm days returned in late fall and it felt like summer but everyone knew it was a lie, they gave it a name they deemed appropriate." </p><p> "I didn't know." </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Yes, what?" </p><p> "I do love Indian summer." He pointed to the right. "Turn here." </p><p> "I know." </p><p> Dross pulled onto a side road even smaller and rougher than the one they'd just followed, and they slipped into the blue shadow of a high ridge where a cool darkness had settled among the pine trees. The red-orange rays of the setting sun fell across the birches that crowned the hilltops, and the white trunks seemed consumed by a raging fire. </p><p> "I wish you had let me take the call alone," Dross said. </p><p> "As soon as you hit that skunk, so did I." He smiled briefly. "You know my policy." </p><p> "I responded to a lot of calls on the rez when Wally was sheriff, and Soderberg." </p><p> "I'm sheriff now. Domestic disturbances can turn ugly, even between people as harmless as Eli and Lucy." </p><p> "Then send another deputy with me. You don't always have to go on the rez calls." </p><p> "When you're sheriff, you can do things your way." </p><p> Life, Cork knew, was odder than a paisley duck.

The new edition contains 10,000 more terms (35,000 in all) and 500 more full-color, computer-generated illustrations (6000 in all). The 17 chapters are organized by broad subject categories (e.g., "Animal Kingdom," "Food and Kitchen," and "Arts and Architecture") and incorporate a wide variety of items, from astronomy to evolution to modern life. But this book is far from inclusive; for instance, neither bobcats nor recorders are included, though readers will find both panpipes and the lyre. Also, the occasional British term may confuse American readers; e.g., "color circle" is used instead of the more common "color wheel," and "American football" appears instead of simply "football." The illustrations range in size from large enough for every minute detail to be easily visible (e.g., motorcycle) to small enough to require a magnifying glass (e.g., ichthyostega). Except for the preface, table of contents, and index, the only text in this book consists of chapter headings, themes, titles, subtitles, and actual terms. Furthermore, the index lists all illustrated terms but does not list subject categories. For example, neither dinosaur nor Jurassic Period appears in the index, but nothosaur and tyrannosaur do. Although not an essential purchase, this visual dictionary offers diagrams detailed enough for the average browser if not for those who need more in-depth analysis of specific terms. Also, students who need "that" picture for a school assignment will find it useful, as will those whose first language is not English. For public libraries.<br><i>Laurie Selwyn, Grayson Cty.

My mind, my heart.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At just past 6:00 p.m., the sky was black, and the icy January air hovered over the ground as a thick, misty fog. Snow clung to the dirt in patches, and my heart felt as dead as the wintry world around me. Silently, I trudged through the park and tugged my knit gloves tighter. I wanted only to be happy and for life to be a little easier, but everything seemed to be getting worse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of me, the park was dark and silent. Once full of life and laughter, my soul was the same. Play equipment, empty and laced with frost, sat motionless. In the other direction, lights from the town attempted to penetrate the fog. The idea of going home caused a heavy weight to sink in my stomach. I didn&#x2019;t want to face my parents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold seeped through my jeans and coat as I sat down on the hard wooden seat of a nearby swing. Frozen chains creaked softly, and my thoughts took me back to all the times I&#x2019;d played at this park during happy childhood days&#x2014;too many to count. Now I was seventeen; those days were long past.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Why does life have to be so painful?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned in the swing, twisting the chains above my head tighter and tighter. Then I released. My body unwound in a slow turn. If only the invisible chains wrapped around my heart would free as easily.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car drove by, and my body tensed. The park closed at dusk. Policemen patrolled the area, and I knew if they found me they&#x2019;d send me home.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I don&#x2019;t want to go back... I just can&#x2019;t do it.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;d never hung out in this park at night before. I didn&#x2019;t like being there, but I had no idea where else to go. I just needed time&#x2014;time to figure out what to do next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My gaze turned to the two sets of railroad tracks at the edge of the park. The first set of tracks was empty. A cluster of six cars sat on the second set. I knew the cops wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see me there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sluggishly, I made my way over to the line of railroad cars. My eyes zeroed in on the last car. I climbed up the side of it and sat, dangling my legs. I&#x2019;m not sure how much time passed. Maybe an hour, maybe two. The danger of sitting on the train car put me on edge. After all the years living so near the railroad tracks, I&#x2019;d never ventured this close.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blew warm air into my hands, trying to thaw them, but it did little good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What&#x2019;s wrong with me?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else seemed to be able to handle the burdens, the struggles of life, better than I could. All I wanted was to be happy. To have the perfect life I always thought I had when I was a kid. But my arms had grown tired from trying to hold my fantasy world together.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, it seemed I couldn&#x2019;t do anything right. I wasn&#x2019;t there for my friends and family when they needed me. I was doing horribly in school, and I&#x2019;d become a worry to my family. Now I was &#x201c;grounded until further notice.&#x201d; I pushed the most recent argument with my parents out of my mind. And then there was the pain that ran even deeper than that. Memories too painful to think about. I pushed them back below the surface, as I had for months. In the past year I&#x2019;d started smoking, drinking, and partying with my friends on the weekends, futilely trying to escape the pain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked down at the railroad tracks and remembered a time I&#x2019;d realized the power of a train. <i>A train would kill anyone in an instant. No one could survive that.</i> <i>If I ever wanted to take my life, if ever...that&#x2019;s the way I&#x2019;d do it.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold air around me brought me back to the moment. A deeper chill settled into my bones&#x2014;and my thoughts grew darker; I knew I didn&#x2019;t want anyone to worry about me anymore. More than that, I wanted the<br>pain to stop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If I ever want my life to end...this would be my chance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#x2019;s not going to get better. There&#x2019;s no reason I need to be here. There&#x2019;s nothing I&#x2019;m supposed to do here. They&#x2019;d be better off without me.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to think of a reason to stay around, to live, but I could think of only one, my two nephews.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I&#x2019;m not a very good example anymore. They&#x2019;re probably better off without me anyway, and I don&#x2019;t have any kids of my own. No younger brothers and sisters either. There&#x2019;s nothing important I&#x2019;m supposed to do. My family, my friends...They&#x2019;ll get over me, right? I&#x2019;m just causing pain and problems.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around again at the cold, dark night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This night is icky.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is disgusting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life sucks.</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could all be over soon, and then I won&#x2019;t hurt anymore.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about school the next day. The homework I hadn&#x2019;t done.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;I&#x2019;m such a failure</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Do I want my life to end? If the train comes, should I end it?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicting thoughts ping-ponged, faster, faster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s going to get better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn&#x2019;t going to get better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s a reason I&#x2019;m here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s no reason I&#x2019;m here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;m supposed to do here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s nothing I&#x2019;m supposed to do here.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was cold, and it was late. I wanted to leave, but I didn&#x2019;t know where to go.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a train whistle split the air. My heart pounded. I hadn&#x2019;t expected the train. Not yet. I still hadn&#x2019;t decided what to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew it would be a long time before the next train. <i>This is my chance</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts came as fast as the train speeding toward me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;I&#x2019;m so cold. This might be the only train for a while.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I did it, the pain, the heartache, the numbness would be over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I&#x2019;m gonna do it. Soon it will </i>all <i>be over.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood between the parked train cars. I glanced across the dip between the tracks I was on and the ones the approaching train was speeding down.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited until the train got closer. I didn&#x2019;t want the engineer to see me. I didn&#x2019;t want him to stop the train. The large outline of the train&#x2019;s engine was barely visible beyond the bright headlight. It was almost here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven waited for me. I was sure of it. I was a good person.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Heaven has to be better than this life.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart pounded as I ran up the small bank. The train&#x2019;s headlight illuminated me. Its horn blared. I tried to push down the fear and shame, turned my face away from the train, and lay facedown.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clenched my fists, crossed my arms under my head, and braced myself, closing my eyes tight. My head and body lay between the tracks, my legs hung over the rail. I could feel the cold metal against my thighs and the wood and rocks under my stomach. As the train closed in, the ground shook so much that my whole body vibrated. Then the train was upon me, over me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain overwhelmed me. The train roared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of the cars pulled at me, as if the train were trying to suck me into itself. The wind tugged harder, wrenching at my jacket and yanking my hair upward. My body rose, lifting slightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, even more powerful than the wind and the momentum of the train, another force pushed me to the ground. My head and chest hit first, then my hips and legs. Again I felt the power of the train, the shaking of the ground, the roar of it moving over me. The force of the weight pushing me down hurt more than anything else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear coursed through me. I squeezed my eyes tighter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;It&#x2019;s going to be over now. The pain is going to end. I&#x2019;ll be in heaven soon</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the whistle blew again, the vibration of my body stilled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound stopped. The wind stopped. The train stopped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Am I dead yet?</i><br><br>If you&#x2019;re struggling with suicidal thoughts...<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know how you feel.

He lives in Northern California with his family. Read more about the inspiration behind Jonathan&#39;s work.<p>--<i>BOOKLIST,</i> <b>Starred Review,</b> November 1, 1993<br> On a cold, northern night, the "wild, untamed music" of Gray Wolfs howling can be heard bouncing off the moon. Having recently "lost his mate to a man's steel trap," Gray Wolf is alone and restless as he hunts his snow-covered territory. But when he encounters a wolf pack, a young white wolf steps forth to go with him and be his mate, and he is alone no more. Beginning with the dramatic close-up Gray Wolf looking outward from the dust jacket, noted wildlife artist Van Zyle lures the reader into the wolf's moonlit world in a series of double-page paintings. An effective counterpoint to these powerful images, London's narration is spare and crisply poetic. Together, the two have created a potent vision of a winter interlude as seen through the eyes of Gray Wolf. Imbued with an obvious passion for this majestic endangered animal, the book concludes with a list of organizations working to preserve the wolf and a note from the author appealing for the reader's concern and efforts on behalf of the wolf.<br> </p><p> --<i>AMERICAN BOOKSELLER,</i> <b>Pick of the Lists,</b> August 1993<br> With sparse, poetic text a drama unfolds of Gray Wolf who is wandering alone on a winter's night after losing his mate to a hunter's steel trap. There is suspense as Gray Wolf encounters a wolf pack where many pairs of eyes gleem at him through the darkness. Will he be accepted into the pack? The illustrations by one of Alaska's premier wildlife artists portray the vastness and the beauty of the wolf's domain. The back of the book lists a number of organizations that are working towards protecting the wolf and reintroducing it into native habitats.<br> </p><p>--<i>SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL,</i> January 1994<br> In poetic prose as spare as the Northern setting it portrays, a crucial moment in the life of a wolf who has lost his mate to man is described. Gray Wolf hunts on a moonlit winter night until suddenly his senses alert him to the presence of a strange pack. White Wolf steps out, the two animals meet, circling each other, leaving together, and eventually become the leaders of a new pack. The strength of this story is in its art. The moon is a powerful presence, washing over the snow, lighting the wolves' eyes with intensity, highlighting their bristling fur, offering shadows of the pack that never steps into its light. Van Zyle's brushstrokes are rich with texture, drawing readers into the environment and the story. A map sponging the animal's past and present ranges, an extensive list of conservation organizations, and an excellent author's note that briefly discusses history, behavior, and endangered status contribute to the authority of the book. Superior art and minimalist text offer a more accessible and gripping glimpse of the wolf than that found in Jim Murphy's <i>The Call of the Wolves</i> (Scholastic, 1989).<br> </p><p>--<i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY,</i> August 16, 1993<br> Gray Wolf, bereft of his mate, hunts alone in the snow-bright night, unknowingly infringing on another pack's territory. "His eyes burn like steady flames. The leader of the pack stares back. Their eyes lock. The moon burns a hole in the night." Returning to the ambience of <i>The Owl Who Became the Moon,</i> London recreates this single moment--frozen in time, saturated with tension and possibility. And the power of this moment generates a story. Words pour out, as fierce as the arctic cold or as luminous as the yellow moon (a wolf "floats over the snow . . . flowing like water"), evoking genuine feeling without humanizing animals, and portraying nature without being teacherly. In his full-spread watercolors, Van Zyle--an Iditarod racer who keeps a team of Siberian huskies (close descendants of the wolf)--depicts the arctic night and its wolves with uncommon intimacy and ease.

He saw the family in silhouette against the windows; the windows looked out into a garden closed darkly in upon by walls. There were so many of the family it seemed as though they must have multiplied during the night; their flesh gleamed pinkly in the cold northern light and they were always moving. Often, like the weary shepherd, he could have prayed them to keep still that he might count them.<br><br>They turned at his entrance profiles and three-quarter faces towards him. There was a silence of suspended munching and little bulges of food were thrust into their cheeks that they might wish him perfunctory good-mornings.<br><br>Miss Emily further inquired whether he had slept well, with a little vivacious uptilt of her chin. Her voice was muffled: he gathered that the contents of her mouth was bacon, because she was engaged in sopping up the liquid fat from her plate with little dice of bread, which she pushed around briskly with a circular movement of her fork. It was not worth sitting down till she had finished, because he would be expected to take her plate away. Why was the only empty chair always beside Miss Emily?<br><br>Last night in the lamplight he had almost begun to think he liked Miss Emily. She was the only lady present who had not beaten time with hand or foot or jerking head while they played 'Toreador Song' on the gramophone. But here, pressed in upon her by the thick fumes of coffee and bacon, the doggy-smelling carpet, the tight, glazed noses of the family ready to split loudly from their skins. . . . There was contamination in the very warm edge of her plate, as he took it from her with averted head and clattered it down among the others on the sideboard.<br><br>'Bacon?' insinuated Mrs Russel. 'A little chilly, I'm afraid. I do hope there's plenty, but we early birds are sometimes inclined to be rather ravenous.<br><br>She added: 'There's an egg,' but there was no invitation in her tone.<br><br>She could never leave a phrase unmodified. He could have answered with facetious emphasis that he was almost inclined to believe he would rather have enjoyed that egg.<br><br>Dumbly, he took two rashers of the moist and mottled bacon.<br><br>'And then,' Hilary Bevel was recounting, 'it all changed, and we were moving very quickly through a kind of pinkish mist--running, it felt like, only all my legs and arms were somewhere else. That was the time when you came into it, Aunt Willoughby. You were winding up your sewing machine like a motor car, kneeling down, in a sort of bunching bathing dress. . . .' She dared indelicacy, reaching out for the marmalade with a little agitated rustle to break up the silence with which her night's amazing experiences had been received.<br><br>Miss Emily, always kindly, tittered into her cup. She kicked the leg of Rossiter's chair and apologized; and he watched her thin, sharp shoulders shining through her blouse.<br><br>Mrs Russel's eye travelled slowly round the table; there slowed and ceased the rotatory mastication of her jaws. Above her head was a square of white light reflected across from the window to the overmantel. He wished that the sheen of the tablecloth were snow, and that he could heap it over his head as that eye came round towards him.<br><br>'Now for it,' he braced himself, clenching his hands upon his knife and fork, and squaring his elbows till one touched Miss Emily, who quivered.<br><br>'I'm afraid you couldn't hardly have heard the gong this morning, Mr Rossiter. That new girl doesn't hardly know how to make it sound yet. She seems to me just to give it a sort of rattle.'<br><br>Damn her impudence. She censored him for being late.<br><br>'Oh, I--I heard it, thank you!'<br><br>They had all stopped talking, and ate quite quietly to hear him speak. Only Jervis Bevel drained his coffee-cup with a gulp and gurgle.<br><br>'The fact is, I was--er--looking for my collar-stud.'<br><br>'Ah, yes. I'm afraid you've sometimes been a little reckless about buying new ones before you were quite sure you'd lost the others, haven't you, Mr Rossiter? Only fancy,'--she looked round to collect the attention of the breakfasters; there was a sensation to follow--'Annie found three good ones, really good ones, under the wardrobe, when she was turning out your room.'<br><br>'I can't think how they get there,' he protested, conscious of inanity.<br><br>'Perhaps they took little legs unto themselves and walked,' suggested Hilary Bevel.<br><br>'Perhaps the wardrobe got up in the night and sat on top of them,' bettered Miss Emily.<br><br>There was a rustle of laughter, and she cast down her eyes with a deprecatory titter.<br><br>The remark was a success. It was really funny. It was received by Mrs Russel with a warm benignity: 'Really, Emily, you do say silly things.' She laughed her gentle breathy laugh, gazing at Mr Rossiter, who wriggled.<br><br>'I say--er--Bevel, when you've finished with that newspaper--' <br><br>Jervis Bevel looked insolently at him over the top of the paper.<br><br>'Sorry, I've only just begun. I left it lying on your plate some time, then I didn't think you'd have much time to read it, being rather rushed.'<br><br>Rossiter hated Bevel, with his sleek head. He was not aware that he was rushed. What business had Bevel got to tell him so?<br><br>'Well, when you have finished--'<br><br>Hilary Bevel was staring at him across the table as though she had never seen him before. She had eyebrows like her brother's, owl's eyebrows, and long-lidded, slanting eyes; and affected a childish directness and ingenuousness of speech which she considered attractive. Her scarlet, loose-lipped mouth curled itself round her utterances, making them doubly distinct.<br><br>'Mr Rossiter's got another tie on, a crimson tie!' said Hilary Bevel.<br><br>Rossiter was instantly aware, not only of his tie but of his whole body visible above the table-edge. He felt his ears protruding fanwise from his head, felt them redden, and the blush burn slowly across his cheekbones, down his pricking skin to the tip of his nose.<br><br>Mrs Russel's attention was temporarily directed from himself by a skirmish with Aunt Willoughby. The click of swords was audible to all.<br><br>'Oh, but you wouldn't, Aunt Willoughby. Not when they've got five or six rooms to settle up every day, you wouldn't. You see, with you, when poor uncle was alive, it was a different thing altogether. What I mean to say is, in proportion to the size of the family you had more of them, in a kind of way. It was a larger staff.'<br><br>'Ah then, Rosie, but what I always used to say, "You do what I expect of you and we won't expect any more than that. I'm reasonable," I used to say, "I won't expect any more than that." Annie could tell you that was what I used to say to her. As my dear husband used to say,' Aunt Willoughby raised her voice, anticipating an interruption, 'there are those that can get good work out of their servants and those that can't. We mustn't be set up about it; it's just a gift, like other gifts, that many haven't got. I've had such a happy, happy home,' she sighed towards the attentive Miss Emily. 'Always so comfortable, it was.'<br><br>'Annie is a funny girl,' reflected Mrs Russel; she said to me--of course I never take the things those girls say seriously--"I wouldn't go back to Mrs Willoughby not for anything you might give me, I wouldn't." I said, "But she spoke so well of you, Annie," and she just wagged her head at me, sort of. She is a funny girl! Of course, I didn't ought to tell you, but it made me laugh at the time, it did really.'<br><br>'I came down on her rather hard,' admitted Aunt Willoughby swiftly. 'I was so particular, you see, and she had some dirty ways. Now I shouldn't wonder--when was it you lost those collar-studs, Mr Rossiter?'<br><br>'I don't exactly remember,' said Rossiter, basely. He felt Mrs Russel's approval warm upon him, but was sorry to have failed Aunt Willoughby, who, disconcerted, relapsed into irrelevancy.<br><br>Miss Emily harked back.<br><br>'Oh, Hilary, you are awful--why shouldn't he?'<br><br>'Well, I didn't say he shouldn't, I simply said it was one. They'll be jealous of you at the office, won't they, Mr Rossiter?'<br><br>Mr Rossiter, eyeing her contemplatively, supposed that Miss Bevel was a 'merry' girl.<br><br>'It may mean an occasion for Mr Rossiter,' said Mrs Russel from her Olympia behind the urn. 'You shouldn't draw attention to it, girls.'<br><br>The light glanced on Hilary's waved and burnished hair as she turned her head towards Aunt Willoughby.<br><br>'Nobody takes any notice of little me, when I go gadding, do they, Auntie! Why, it's all round the table in a minute if I come down with half an inch of new coloured cammie-ribbon sticking out above my jumper!'<br><br>'You wouldn't put it in at all if you didn't think it was going to notice,' remarked her brother, without raising his eyes from the <i>Daily Express</i>.<br><br>'I wouldn't put on anything at all if I was quite invisible, if that's what you mean!'<br><br>Miss Emily glanced apprehensively at the unshaken barricade of newspaper.<br><br>'Oh, Hilary, you are awf--'<br><br>Jervis had apparently not heard.<br><br>'Hilary!' said Mrs Russel, 'I'm afraid you're shocking Mr Rossiter!' She lingered on the name as though he were something delicious to eat.<br><br>'I believe,' thought Rossiter, 'they all want to marry me! Is this insight or delirium? P'raps not Aunt Willoughby, but--'<br><br>He appraised Jervis round the edge of the newspaper. Surely he was showier, mote attractive? Why couldn't he divert some of their attentions; take on, say, Miss Emily and Mrs Russel? Mrs Russel was old enough to be the mother of either of them.<br><br>A hand shot out suddenly from behind the urn. Rossiter jumped.<br><br>'--had your second cup of coffee yet,' Mrs Russel was saying. 'You look quite poetic, Mr Rossiter'--she was referring to his abstracted glare--'Aren't you going to pass along your cup?'<br><br>'Thank you--half a cup, if you please.'<br><br>'There's no hurry.' She glanced over her shoulder at the round relentless clock--face on the mantel. 'You see, you eat rather faster than the others, Mr Rossiter, though they have had a bit of a start this morning!'<br><br>Did he really bolt his food and make, perhaps, disgusting noises with his mouth?<br><br>'That's why I always say we'd rather breakfast early--all of us, even the ones who haven't necessarily got to rush. It's so much homier, one feels, than rough-and-tumble modern breakfast nowadays. Everybody sort of rushing in and scrambling and snatching and making grabs at things off a table at the side. There's nothing so homely,' said Mrs Russel with conscious brilliance, 'as a comfortable sit-down family to breakfast.'<br><br>'My God!' said Jervis irritably, 'there's going to be another strike on that damned railway--they're cutting down the trains again. Why pretend railways are a convenience--that's what I should like to know?'<br><br>No one could tell him.<br><br>He pushed his chair back from the table, impatiently, and crossed his legs.<br><br>'Pore old thing, then,' trilled Hilary. 'Diddums wazzums cwoss.<br><br>'They're not taking off the eight-forty-seven, are they?'<br><br>'Not the eight-forty-seven?'<br><br>'They are. That means either the eight--twenty-seven or the eight-fifty-three. The eight-fifty-three!'<br><br>'The eight-twenty-seven,' they decided unanimously.<br><br>'Then that'll just have to mean breakfast earlier,' said Mrs Russel brightly; 'you won't mind, will you, girls?' Her appeal included Aunt Willoughby, who made no response. 'You see, we couldn't hardly rush them over their breakfasts, could we?'<br><br>This was 'home comforts.' This was one of the privileges for which Rossiter paid her twenty-four shillings a week. Being sat round and watched while you were eating. Not being rushed. He had a vision of a 'rushed breakfast,' of whirling endlessly through space while one snapped at a sausage with little furtive bites; of munching bread and marmalade with the wind of one's velocity whistling through one's teeth.<br><br>Would it be better? Could it be worse?<br><br>Not worse than his chair-edge creaking against Miss Emily's; the unceasing consciousness of her unceasing consciousness of him. Not worse than Hilary Bevel, viv-a-vis; with her complacent prettiness, her tinkling, laboured witticisms. Not worse than Aunt Willoughby's baffled, bearded morosity; than Jervis Bevel's sleek disdain.<br><br>He would escape from Mrs Russel, her advances, her criticisms, her fumbling arguments that crushed you down beneath their heavy gentleness until you felt you were being trampled to death by a cow. By a blind cow, that fumbled its way backwards and forwards across you . . .<br><br>The 'girls' delivered their ultimatum in chorus.<br><br>'England expects,' declaimed Hilary, turning her eyes towards the ceiling, 'effery woman to-er--do-er herr dew-ty.'<br><br>'It's nice to be down early,' said Miss Emily earnestly, 'with a nice long day stretching out in front of me.'<br><br>'Breakfast will be at quarter to eight sharp,' said Mrs Russel. 'Mr Rossiter, we really must try not to lose our collar-studs.'<br><br>All his days and nights were loops, curving out from breakfast time, curving back to it again. Inexorably the loops grew smaller, the breakfasts longer; looming more and more over his nights, eating more and more out of his days.<br><br>Jervis Bevel's eyes swerved over to the mantelpiece. He pushed his chair back farther over the bristling carpet pile.<br><br>'Well,' he said, 'I think it's almost time--'<br><br>The room broke up, the table grew smaller again as they all rose from their chairs. Mrs Russel and Aunt Willoughby gathered themselves together; Hilary seized Miss Emily by the back of the waist and punted her laughingly towards the door.<br><br>The coffee and the bacon and the hostility and the christian forbearance blew out before them into the chilly hall.<br>Daffodils<br>Miss MURCHESON stopped at the corner of the High Street to buy a bunch of daffodils from the flower-man. She counted out her money very carefully, pouring a little stream of coppers from her purse into the palm of her hand.<br><br>'--ninepence-ten-eleven-pence halfpenny-a shilling! Thank you very much. Good afternoon.'<br><br>A gust of wind rushed up the street, whirling her skirts up round her like a ballet-dancer's, and rustling the Reckitts-blue paper round the daffodils. The slender gold trumpets tapped and quivered against her face as she held them up with one hand and pressed her skirts down hastily with the other. She felt as though she had been enticed into a harlequinade by a company of Columbines who were quivering with laughter at her discomfiture; and looked round to see if anyone had witnessed her display of chequered moirette petticoat and the inches of black stocking above her boots. But the world remained unembarrassed.<br><br>Today the houses seemed taller and farther apart; the street wider and full of a bright, clear light that cast no shadows and was never sunshine. Under archways and between the houses the distances had a curious transparency, as though they had been painted upon glass. Against the luminous and indeterminate sky the Abbey tower rose distinct and delicate.<br><br>Miss Murcheson, forgetting all confusion, was conscious of her wings. She paused again to hitch up the bundle of exercise books slithering down beneath her elbow, then took the dipping road as a bird swings down into the air. Her mouth was faintly acrid with spring dust and the scent of daffodils was in her nostrils. As she left the High Street farther behind her, the traffic sounded as a faint and murmurous hum, striking here and there a tinkling note like windbells.<br><br>Under her detachment she was conscious of the houses, the houses and the houses.

He was in Russia in 1917 and witnessed the Revolution, which he reported for the Manchester Guardian. After escaping to Scandinavia, he settled in the Lake District of England with his Russian wife where, in 1929, he wrote Swallows and Amazons. Thus began a writing career that has produced some of the best children s literature of all time."There is plenty of excitement, a little danger, a quality of thinking, planning and fun which is delightful and stimulating." -"TLS"<br><br>"He makes a tale of adventure a handbook to adventure." -"Observer"<br><br>- ""Winter Holiday" is my favourite Arthur Ransome, the one into which I want to walk even now -- if only it would just snow. Its depiction of the Lake District in winter is totally compelling.

Inside portrait of Russia and its people. Hardcover with dust jacket, 621 pages, published by Random House.</p><p>As a top New York Times journalist, Hendrick Smith was Bureau Chief and Chief Correspondent for nearly a decade, and his overseas assignments included Vietnam, Cairo, Paris and Moscow. His reporting from Moscow 1971-4 won him a Pulitzer Prize, and he was also a member of the Pulitzer Prize-winning team that produced the Pentagon Papers series in the New York Times. His two previous books, The Power Game: how Washington really works and The Russians, have both been bestsellers. This edition of The New Russians have been updated and includes four new chapters including the &#39;coup&#39; and its aftermath.YA-- The crucial value of Smith's book on the contemporary Russian "revolution" now unfolding under Gorbachev lies in its grassroots, man-on-the-street emphasis. The origins and historical evolution of glasnost and perestroika have been dealt with elsewhere. What Smith does incomparably well is to give readers a look at the national Russian character, based on several remarkable interviews with people of all ages, occupations, and situations. Part of the book deals with the Russian work ethic ("they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work!") and the chronic inertia and dependency of individuals within the Communist economy. This is a wonderful book for YAs, simply because the ordinary daily activities and frustrations of living in the U.S.S.R. are so vividly and relevantly portrayed. If young people are not deterred by the thickness of the volume and simply dig in, they will find that the reward is well worth the effort.<br><i>- Vicki Fox, R. E.

But his blog GuerrillaGardening.org attracted other guerrillas from around the world to share their experiences of the horticultural front line with him and become a focal point for guerrilla gardeners everywhere. <i>On Guerrilla Gardening </i>is a lively colourful treatise about why people illicitly cultivate land and how to do it. From discretely beautifying corners of Montreal to striving for green communal space in Berlin and sustainable food production in San Francisco, from small gestures of fun in Zurich to bold political statements in Brazil, cultivating land beyond your boundary is a battle many different people are fighting. Unearthed along the way are the movement's notable historic advances by seventeenth century English radicals, a nineteenth century American entrepreneur and artists in 1970s New York. Reynolds has researched the subject with guerrilla gardeners from thirty different countries and compiles their advice on what to grow, how to cope with adverse environmental conditions, how to seed bomb effectively and to use propaganda to win support.</p><p><i>On Guerrilla Gardening </i>gives entertaining inspiration, practical reference and no excuses for not getting out there and gardening.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Reynolds </b>was born in 1977 and grew up gardening with his family. His first illegal cultivation was at college, where he planted windowsills with boxes of Busy Lizzies. He has been a guerrilla gardener in earnest since 2004; his Guerrilla Gardening organization now has thousands of active members worldwide and has been featured on ABC, NPR, the BBC, <i>Richard and Judy</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and many other places. Aside from his guerrilla activity, he works as an advertising planner. He lives in London.</p>With the rallying cry, "Let's fight the filth with forks and flowers," this lighthearted guide is a seriously silly romp through the adventurous pastime of gardening other people's plots. Reynolds, after five months living in a 10-story tower block in London, missed gardening and began surreptitiously cultivating the planters in front of his building, gardening in the dead of night to avoid interference. He started a blog to share his delight in illicit gardening, and discovered he was part of an international movement. Reynolds draws inspiration from pioneers of the movement: New York community gardens built on vacant lots, dispossessed Honduran Chiquita workers who appropriated abandoned banana plantation land, and Gerrard Winstanley, founder of the short-lived but influential Diggers who, in the tumultuous year of 1649, planted beans and barley on public land in Surry, England, "that every one that is born in the land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation." He borrows techniques from more infamous guerrillas such as Che Guevera and Mao Tse Tung ("the guerrilla 'must move with the fluidity of water and the ease of the blowing wind'"). Both a manifesto and a manual (tips include how to build seed bombs and deal with pests unique to the guerrilla form of gardening: authorities and landowners), the book delights with tales of exploits from the anarchic, artistic community of guerrilla gardeners. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What makes it different from other small, one or one-and-a-half story houses? Many say that it's hard to describe, but you know one when you see it. And knowing one when you see it is all about knowing how to spot the details. With Arts &amp; Crafts homes, it is often the way the details are combined, and the philosophy they represent, that makes a house an authentic Arts and Crafts bungalow. It is not just knee braces in the gable, nor a river rock column, or a three part front window. In their latest book, bungalow experts Jane Powell and Linda Svendsen identify the finer points and visual characteristics that make a bungalow a bungalow, and show how to incorporate these important details into your bungalow. The authors skillfully explain how to identify the details and the ways of blending them, and offer insight into the Arts &amp; Crafts philosophy behind their use. A sleeping porch, a pergola, an exposed rafter tail, an extensive use of wood, stone, and brick: none of these things by themselves characterize a bungalow. With Bungalow Details, however, anyone can become a bungalow expert, and be able to confidently "know a bungalow when they see one." Jane Powell is the proprietor of House Dressing, a business dedicated to renovating and preserving old homes. She is a frequent lecturer and consultant, and is the author of Bungalow Kitchens and Bungalow Bathrooms. Linda Svendsen, a graduate of Music and Art High School and Parsons School of Design in New York, has been a renowned photographer for more than thirty years. Her work is showcased in numerous magazines and books; she is the author of Bicycle: Around the World.</p><p><p>What defines an Arts &amp; Crafts bungalow?

This book celebrates the uniqueness of the southern garden. It&#39;s remarkably well organized, with colored page edges demarcating the different sections, the largest of which is the alphabetized plant encyclopedia in the middle. The best part of the book, however, may be the substantial section titled &#34;Plant Selection Guide,&#34; which consists of a series of illustrated lists: &#34;Fragrant Plants,&#34; &#34;Plants that Attract Butterflies,&#34; &#34;Plants Easy to Propagate,&#34; &#34;Plants That Tolerate Drought,&#34; etc. With its lay-flat binding and excellent index, it&#39;s sure to be a favorite garden reference for quite a few gardeners, southern or otherwise.</p><h2>Spoon Fishing for Steelhead</h2><p>One of the most effective ways to hook steelhead (as well as salmon) is with a spoon.

Scores of color photos printed on thick, glossy, quality paper enhance the learning experience along with many line drawings, graphs and illustrations.

Dr. Mohler and family live in Louisville, Kentucky.In every generation, the church is commanded to &#x201c;contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.&#x201d; That is no easy task, and it is complicated by the multiple attacks upon Christian truth that mark our contemporary age. Assaults upon the Christian faith are no longer directed only at isolated doctrines.The entire structure of Christian truth is now under attack by those who would subvert Christianity&#x2019;s theological integrity.<br><br>Today&#x2019;s Christian faces the daunting task of strategizing which Christian doctrines and theological issues are<br>to be given highest priority in terms of our contemporary context. This applies both to the public defense of Christianity in face of the secular challenge and the internal responsibility of dealing with doctrinal disagreements.<br>Neither is an easy task, but theological seriousness and maturity demand that we consider doctrinal issues in terms of their relative importance. God&#x2019;s truth is to be defended at every point and in every detail, but responsible Christians must determine which issues deserve first rank attention in a time of theological crisis.<br><br>A trip to the local hospital emergency room some years ago alerted me to an intellectual tool that is most helpful in fulfilling our theological responsibility. In recent years, emergency medical personnel have practiced a discipline known as triage&#x2014;a process that allows trained personnel to make a quick evaluation of relative medical urgency. Given the chaos of an emergency room reception area, someone must be armed with the medical expertise to make an immediate determination of medical priority. Which patients should be rushed into surgery? Which patients can wait for a less urgent examination? Medical personnel cannot flinch from asking these questions and from taking responsibility to give the patients with the most critical needs top priority in terms of treatment.<br><br>The word <i>triage </i>comes from the French word <i>trier, </i>which means &#x201c;to sort.&#x201d; Thus, the triage officer in the medical context is the front-line agent for deciding which patients need the most urgent treatment.Without such a process, the scraped knee would receive the same urgency of consideration as a gunshot wound to the chest. The same discipline that brings order to the hectic arena of the emergency room can also offer great assistance to Christians defending truth in the present age.<br><br>A discipline of theological triage would require Christians to determine a scale of theological urgency that would correspond to the medical world&#x2019;s framework for medical priority.With this inmind, I would suggest three different levels of theological urgency, each corresponding to a set of issues and theological priorities found in current doctrinal debates.<br><br>First-level theological issues would include those doctrines most central and essential to the Christian faith.<br>Included among these most crucial doctrines would be doctrines such as the Trinity, the full deity and humanity<br>of Jesus Christ, justification by faith, and the authority of Scripture.<br><br>In the earliest centuries of the Christian movement, heretics directed their most dangerous attacks upon the<br>church&#x2019;s understanding of who Jesus is, and in what sense He is the very Son of God. Other crucial debates concerned the question of how the Son is related to the Father and the Holy Spirit. The earliest creeds and councils of the church were, in essence, emergency measures taken to protect the central core of Christian doctrine. At historic turning points such as the councils at Nicaea, Constantinople, and Chalcedon, orthodoxy was vindicated and heresy was condemned&#x2014;and these councils dealt with doctrines of unquestionable first-order importance. Christianity stands or falls on the affirmation that Jesus Christ is fully man and fully God.</p><h2>Drinking from the Hidden Fountain : A Patristic Breviary - Ancient Wisdom for Today&#39;s World</h2><p>This collection of carefully selected passages from the Fathers of the Church sets out a plan for meditation during the course of the year.

Scott Fitzgerald for its simple and precise use of language to convey a wide range of complex emotions, and it earned Hemingway a place beside Sherwood Anderson and Gertrude Stein among the most promising American writers of that period. <i>In Our Time</i> contains several early Hemingway classics, including the famous Nick Adams stories "Indian Camp," "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife," "The Three Day Blow," and "The Battler," and introduces readers to the hallmarks of the Hemingway style: a lean, tough prose -- enlivened by an car for the colloquial and an eye for the realistic that suggests, through the simplest of statements, a sense of moral value and a clarity of heart. </p><p> Now recognized as one of the most original short story collections in twentieth-century literature, <i>In Our Time</i> provides a key to Hemingway's later works.</p></p><p>No writer has been more efficiently overshadowed by his imitators than Ernest Hemingway. From the moment he unleashed his stripped-down, declarative sentences on the world, he began breeding entire generations of miniature Hemingways, who latched on to his subtractive style without ever wondering what he'd removed, or why. And his tendency to lapse into self-parody during the latter half of his career didn't help matters. But <i>In Our Time</i>, which Hemingway published in 1925, reminds us of just how fresh and accomplished his writing could be--and gives at least an inkling of why Ezra Pound could call him the finest prose stylist in the world.<p> In his first commercially published book (following the small-press appearance of <i>Three Stories and Ten Poems</i> in 1924), Hemingway was still wearing his influences on his sleeve. The vignettes between each story smack of Gertrude Stein, whose minimalist punctuation and clodhopping rhythms he was happy to borrow. "My Old Man" sounds like Huck Finn on the Grand Tour: "Well, we went to live at Maisons-Lafitte, where just about everybody lives except the gang at Chantilly, with a Mrs. Meyers that runs a boarding house. Maisons is about the swellest place to live I've ever seen in all my life." But in the "The Battler" or "Indian Camp" or "Big Two-Hearted River," Hemingway finds his own voice, shunning the least hint of rhetorical inflation and sticking to just the facts, ma'am. His reluctance to traffic in high-flown abstraction has often been chalked up to postwar disillusion--as though he were too much of a simpleton to make deliberate stylistic decisions. Still, nobody can read "Soldier's Home" without drawing a certain connection between the two. Returning home to Oklahoma, the hero finds that his tales of combat are now a bankrupt genre: </p><blockquote> Even his lies were not sensational at the pool room. His acquaintances, who had heard detailed accounts of German women found chained to machine guns in the Argonne forest and who could not comprehend, or were barred by their patriotism from interest in, any German machine gunners who were not chained, were not thrilled by his stories. </blockquote> If we are to believe Michael Reynolds and Ann Douglas, this passage reflects the author's own dreary homecoming as a member of the lost generation. It's also a fine example of a surprisingly rare phenomenon, at least at this point in his career: Hemingway being funny. <i>--James Marcus</i>Born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1899, Ernest Hemingway served in the Red Cross during World War I as an ambulance driver and was severely wounded in Italy. He moved to Paris in 1921, devoted himself to writing fiction, and soon became part of the expatriate community, along with Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and Ford Madox Ford. He revolutionized American writing with his short, declarative sentences and terse prose. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, and his classic novella THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Known for his larger-than-life personality and his passions for bullfighting, fishing, and big-game hunting, he died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961.</p><h2>Yoshitoshi&#39;s Thirty-Six Ghosts</h2><p>Ukiyo-e woodblock prints reproduced in color.</p><p></p><h2>There Is No Death</h2><p>An inspiration and helpful treaties on the nature of death.

Although Webb&#39;s work sparked controversy and sharp criticism, it inspired new thinking about the role of regionalism in the nation&#39;s history.&#34;[Walter Prescott Webb] writes interestingly about large problems, the solution of which should help mankind to understand its past and assist in formulating more socially desirable public and private policies. He is blessed with both a bold mind and a brilliant pen, two assets that have raised him to a position of respect among members of the profession to which he belongs. In [The Great Frontier] Mr. Webb attempts to interpret the history of Western culture from 1500 to the present in terms of the expansion of Europe overseas. Although this theme is not new... it has never before been treated in such a grand manner and with the same points of emphasis as in the present volume.&#34; - New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k</h2><p>&#39;Genius&#39; Cosmopolitan &#39;The best book I have read recently ...Absolutely blinding.

(&#34;Oh, why,&#34; I cried to myself, &#34;don&#39;t we all plant even a short length of copper beech hedge!&#34;) But McTeer&#39;s elegant rendering of the wonderful diction and flair of the mistress of Sissinghurst Castle is the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon of summer gardening, or, better yet, to the contemplation of a summer garden from the cool shade of a hammock.

When Kennedy - a Jesuit, a practicing psychotherapist, and a Zen teacher (sensei) - writes autobiographically, this book is at its best. The book is divided into four sections corresponding to four stages of spiritual life and four stages of alchemy: lead (knowledge), quicksilver (love), sulphur (purification), and gold (union). The diversity of references, from alchemy to Jung to Zen, reflects the eclectic character of the book, which reads like a loosely connected series of homilies with moments of insight but no unitive theory.

They remain a viable political, cultural, and spiritual community in southeastern Massachusetts; Manitonquat (``Medicine Story'') is an elder and storyteller of the Assonet Wampanoag. These 11 tales, each illustrated with a striking, beautifully composed full-page acrylic painting by a Mohawk painter and graphic artist, include creation myths, tribal legends, and pourquoi tales. Most feature the benevolent spirit helper Maushop, credited with creating all the races of man (from the multicolored clays of Gay Head on Martha's Vineyard) as well as the good and useful things of the earth. In relating how Maushop taught the Wampanoag to ``live in harmony always, in the natural joy and beauty of Creation,'' Manitonquat preserves both a storyteller's idiosyncratic voice and his instructional intent. An excellent resource (though a pronunciation guide would have helped), with a multitude of uses: to pair with a historical and cultural survey (e.g., Laurie Weinstein-Farson's The Wampanoag, 1989); for social studies and literature units, comparative mythology, and storytelling. (Folklore. 8+) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 3-6-The Children of the Morning Light are the Wampanoag Indians of Massachusetts-the people who met the Pilgrims at Plymouth. Medicine Story, a respected elder, retells in his own voice 11 tales of his people, focusing on Kiehtan's creation of the world and on Maushop's efforts to assist the Wampanoag in the early days of the world. Some of the selections, such as "Sky Woman and the Twins," might be familiar to readers of the Iroquois story of Creation. But others are unique to the Wampanoag, and probably appear here in print for the first time. They tell how death came to the world, how the Wampanoag came to settle in the Cape Cod area, how the Creator is present in all living creatures, and how winter came to be. Reflecting their roots as a fishing people, the story "Maushop and the Porpoises," which explains why sharks avoid porpoises, is the most unusual tale in the book. Engagingly told with clarity and humor, the stories are particularly good for reading aloud. Each one has a full-color, full-page illustration by Arquette, a Mohawk artist.

Pipher&#39;s alarming tales of a generation swamped by pain may be partly informed by her role as a therapist who sees troubled children and teens, but her sketch of a tougher, more menacing world for girls often hits the mark. She offers some prescriptions for changing society and helping girls resist.Why are more American adolescent girls prey to depression, eating disorders, addictions, and suicide attempts than ever before? According to Dr. Mary Pipher, a clinical psychologist who has treated girls for more than twenty years, we live in a look-obsessed, media-saturated, "girl-poisoning" culture. Despite the advances of feminism, escalating levels of sexism and violence--from undervalued intelligence to sexual harassment in elementary school--cause girls to stifle their creative spirit and natural impulses, which, ultimately, destroys their self-esteem. Yet girls often blame themselves or their families for this "problem with no name" instead of looking at the world around them.<br><br>Here, for the first time, are girls' unmuted voices from the front lines of adolescence, personal and painfully honest.

She lives in Surrey, England with her husband and two children.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Panetto's Daughter<br><br></i>Katherine Swynford, that famous adulteress,1 was set on the path to notoriety, fame, and a great love at the tender age of two or thereabouts, when she was placed in the household of Philippa of Hainault, wife to Edward III of England. This would have been around 1352, and Katherine's disposition with the popular and maternal Philippa was almost certainly due to her father, Sir Paon de Ro�t, having rendered years of faithful service to the Queen and the royal family of Hainault.<br><br>Like her benefactress, Katherine was a Hainaulter. She was born Katherine de Ro�t, her surname variously given as Rouet, Ro�lt, or Ruet, and pronounced Roay. The Ro�ts were a prominent family in Hainault, then an independent principality located in the western reaches of the Holy Roman Empire, bordering on the kingdom of France and occupying much of what is now Belgium. This fertile and prosperous county stretched from Li�ge and Brussels in the north to Lille and Valenciennes in the south, and contained other thriving cloth cities: Mons, Charleroi, and Tournai; all of which provided a market for England's raw wool, her chief export. Formed at the time of the division of Charlemagne's empire in the ninth century, Hainault had been an imperial fief since 1071, and in the early fourteenth century it was ruled by the House of Avesnes, which had come to power in 1244.<br><br>Katherine possibly had noble or even royal connections through her mother, but claims that she was closely related through her father to the aristocratic lords of Roeulx cannot be substantiated. The Roeulx were a great and powerful Hainaulter family that could trace its descent from the ancient counts of Flanders and Hainault, who were themselves descended from the Emperor Charlemagne, and from England's famous King Alfred. William the Conqueror had married a princess of that house, Matilda of Flanders, and by her was the founder of the ruling dynasties of England, the Norman and Plantagenet kings. Since the twelfth century the lords of Roeulx had prospered mightily.2 Their landholdings centered mainly on the town of Le Roeulx, which lies eight miles northeast of Mons, but their name is also associated with Roux, forty miles east of Mons, and Fauroeulx, twenty miles to the south.<br><br>That Katherine shared a close kinship with the lords of Roeulx is doubtful on heraldic evidence alone&#x2014;or the lack of it.3 Her family was relatively humble. The chronicler Jean Froissart, a native of Hainault, who appears to have been quite well informed on Katherine Swynford's background, states that Jean de Ro�t, who died in 1305 and was the son of one Huon de Ro�t, was her grandfather. Neither bore a title. Yet it is possible that there was some blood tie with the Roeulx. Paon de Ro�t, the father of Katherine Swynford, whose name appears in English sources as Payn or Payne,4 and is pronounced Pan,was almost certainly baptized Gilles, a name borne by several members of the senior line of the Roeulx, which is one reason some historians have linked him to this branch of the family.5 Of course, the similarity in surnames suggests a connection in that period, the spellings of Roeulx and Ro�t could be, and were, interchangeable as does the fact that both families are known to have had connections with the area around<br>Mons and Le Roeulx. But discrepancies in arms would appear to indicate that Paon was at best a member of a junior branch of the House of Roeulx; all the same, it is possible that the royal blood of Charlemagne and Alfred the Great did indeed run in Katherine's veins.<br><br>The arms of the town of Le Roeulx were a silver lion on a green field holding a wheel in its paw;6 this is a play on words, for wheel in French is <i>roue, </i>which is similar to, and symbolic of, Roeulx. It was a theme adopted by Paon's own family: His arms were three plain silver wheels on a field of red; they were not the spiked- gold Katherine wheels later used by his daughter.7 On the evidence of heraldic emblems on the vestments given by her to Lincoln Cathedral, Katherine Swynford used not only her familiar device of Katherine wheels, which she adopted after 1396, but also her father's device of three plain silver wheels.8<br><br>If Jean de Ro�t was his father, as seems likely, then Gilles alias Paon was born by 1305&#x2013;06 at the very latest. Thus he did not marry and father children until comparatively late in life. The references in the <i>Cartulaire des Comtes de Hainaut </i>to Gilles de Ro�t called Paon or Paonnet imply that the name Paon was almost certainly a nickname, although it was the name by<br>which Gilles became customarily known, and it even appeared on his tomb memorial. In French, <i>paon </i>means peacock,which suggests that Paon was a vain man who liked dressing in brightly colored, fashionable clothes, possibly in order to impress the ladies. However, in the form <i>pion, </i>it means usher,9 a term that may be descriptive of Paon's duties at court.10<br><br>John of Gaunt's epitaph states that Katherine came from a knightly family,and Paon's knighthood is attested to by several sources,11 although we do not know when he received the accolade. In 1349 he is even referred to as a lord, and his daughter Elizabeth as noble,12 which reflects his landed status and probably his links to aristocratic blood. This is also evident in his<br>ability to place his children with royalty,13 which suggestsin the case of his daughters, at leastthat there was the prospect of some inheritance that would ensure they made good marriages.14 We know Paon held land in Hainault, because in 1411 his grandson, Sir Thomas Swynford, Katherine's son, was to pursue his claim to lands he had inherited there from his mother.15 Paon is unlikely, however, to have owned a large estate and was probably not a wealthy man16 since he was to rely heavily on royal patronage to provide for his children's future.<br><br>Paon had first come to England in December 1327 in the train of Philippa of Hainault, who married the young King Edward III on January 24, 1328, in York Minster. Paon perhaps served as Philippa's usher, and may have been present in that capacity at the royal wedding, which took place in the as yet unroofed minster in the midst of a snowstorm.<br><br>After Philippa's nuptial celebrations had ended, nearly all her Hainaulter servants were sent home. Apart from a handful of ladies, only Paon de Ro�t and Walter de Mauney, her carving squire, are known to have been allowed to remain in her retinue,17 a mark of signal royal favor, which suggests that Paon was highly regarded by both the young king and queen, and was perhaps a kinsman of Philippa, possibly through their shared ancestry.<br><br>That kinship may also have been established, or reinforced, through marriage. No one has as yet successfully identified Katherine's mother, for the name of Paon's wife is not recorded in contemporary documents. The slender evidence we have suggests he perhaps married more than once, that his first marriage took place before ca. 1335, and that his four known children,<br>who were born over a period of about fifteen years or more, may have been two sets of half siblings; in which case Katherine was the child of a second wife, whom he possibly married in the mid late 1340s. We know he maintained links with Hainault, probably through the good offices of Queen Philippa and other members of her house, so it may be that at least one of his wives was a Hainaulter.18<br><br>It is also possible that Katherine's mother herself was related to the ruling family of Hainault,19 and while this theory cannot be proved, it is credible in many respects. If Paon was linked by marriage, as well as by blood, to Queen Philippa, that would further explain his continuing links with the House of Avesnes and the trust in which he and his family were held by the ruling families of England and Hainault. It would explain too why all his children received royal patronage and why Queen Philippa took such an interest in them; and it was possibly one reason why John of Gaunt may have felt it was appropriate to ultimately marry one of them.<br><br>But there is unlikely to have been a close blood tie.20 If Paon' s wife was related to the House of Avesnes, it must have been through a junior branch or connection. Had the kinship been closer, we would expect Paon to have enjoyed more prominence in the courts of England and Hainault. There have, of course, been other unsubstantiated theories as to who Katherine's mother could have been,21 but this is the most convincing.<br><br>Whether Paon was related by marriage to Queen Philippa or not, he was evidently held in high regard by her, and he played his part in the early conflicts of the Hundred Years War, which broke out in 1340 after Edward III claimed the throne of France. For a time Paon served Queen Philippa as Master of the House,22 and in 1332 there is a record of her giving money to Panetto de Ro�t de Hanonia";23 this is the earliest surviving reference to him. His lost epitaph in Old St. Paul's Cathedral describes him as Guienne King of Arms,24 and it may have been through Philippa's influence that he was appointed to this office in ca. 1334,25 Guienne being part of the Duchy of Aquitaine and a fief of the English Crown.<br><br>By the mid- 1340s, Paon was back in Queen Philippa's service as one of the chevaliers of the noble and good Queen.26 In 1346 he fought at Cr�cy under Edward III. That same year, Sir Panetto de Ro�t" was present at the siege of Calais, and in August 1347 he was Marshal of the<br>Queen's Household, and one of two of her knights&#x2014;the other was Sir Walter de Mauney assigned to conduct to her chamber the six burghers who had given themselves up as hostages after Calais fell to Edward III, and whose lives had been spared thanks to the Queen's intercession.27<br><br>Philippa, however, never courted criticism by indiscriminately promoting her compatriots, which may explain why Paon, although well thought of and loved by the Queen because he was her countryman,28 never came to greater prominence at the English court29 and why he eventually sought preferment elsewhere.<br><br>By 1349, the year the Black Death was decimating the population of England and much of Europe, Paon had apparently returned to Hainault. From that year on, there are several references to him in the contemporary <i>Cartulaire des Comtes de Hainaut, </i>the official record of service of the counts of Hainault.30 The first reference concerns a noble adolescent, Elizabeth de Ro�t, daughter of my lord Gilles, called Paonnet, de Ro�t,who, sometime after July 27, 1349, was nominated as a prebendary, or honorary canoness (<i>chanoinness</i>),31 of the chapter of the Abbey of St. Waudru in Mons by Queen Philippa's elder sister, Margaret, sovereign Countess of Hainault and Empress of Germany. The choice of a convent in Mons, so close to the former Roeulx estates, reinforces the theory that Paon was connected to that family and that his lands were located in this area.<br><br>Girls were not normally accepted into the novitiate before the age of thirteen, so Elizabeth de Ro�t, who was described as being adolescent at the time of her placement, was probably born around 1335-36 at the latest. St. Waudru was a prestigious and influential abbey, and it was an honor for a girl to be so placed by Countess Margaret; it further demonstrates the close ties between the Ro�ts and the ruling family of Hainault, and suggests yet again a familial link between them. It was unusual for the eldest girl of a gentle family to enter the cloister, but given the fact that Paon's daughters were both to offer their own daughters as nuns, we might conclude that giving a female child to God was a Ro�t family custom.<br><br>Paon also had a son, Walter de Ro�t, possibly named after Sir Walter de Mauney,32 who in 1355-56 was in the service, in turn, of Countess Margaret and her son, Duke Albert, and Edward III's eldest son and heir, Edward of Woodstock, Prince of Wales, popularly known to history as the Black Prince.As Walter was a Yeoman of the Chamber to the Prince in 1355, and<br>probably fought under his command at Poitiers in 1356, he is likely to have been born no later than 1338-40.<br><br>Between 1350 and 1352 there are seven references to Paon in the <i>Cartulaire des Comtes de Hainaut. </i>For example, on May 11, 1350, he is recorded as preparing to accompany Countess Margaret's sons Duke Albert, Duke William, and Duke Otto on a pilgrimage to the church of St. Martin at Sebourg near Valenciennes to make their devotions at the shrine of the twelfth- century hermit, St. Druon. It was probably in that year that Paon's famous daughter was born.<br><br>C.L. Kingsford, in his article on Katherine Swynford in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography, </i>suggested that she was born in 1350. There is no contemporary record of her date of birth, but since the minimum canonical age at which a girl could be married and have marital intercourse was twelve, and Katherine probably married around 1362-63 and had her first child ca. 1363-64, a date of 1350 is feasible, although she could have been born a little earlier. November 25 is the feast day of St. Katherine, so it is possible that Paon's second daughter was named for the patron saint on whose anniversary she was born, and for whom she was to express great devotion and reverence.<br><br>In the Middle Ages, St. Katherine of Alexandria was one of the most popular of female saints. Edward III and Philippa of Hainault had a special devotion to her; their accounts show that Katherine wheels, the symbol of her martydom, adorned counterpanes on the royal beds, jousting apparel, and other garments. Like other English medieval queens, Philippa was patroness of the royal hospital of St. Katherine- by- the- Tower in London, which had recently been rebuilt under her auspices, and with which Katherine Swynford herself would one day be associated.33<br><br>St. Katherine probably never even existed. There is no record of her in antiquity, and her cult did not emerge until the ninth century. She was said to have been of patrician or even royal birth, beautiful, rich, respected, and learned. Her studies led her to convert to Christianity at a time when Christians were being persecuted in the Roman Empire, and she dared to publicly protest to the Emperor Maxentius (reigned AD 306-312) against the worship of pagan idols and the persecution itself. Maxentius was greatly impressed by her beauty and her courage in adhering to her convictions, and sent fifty of his sages and philosophers to reason with her. When they failed to demolish her arguments, he was so infuriated that he had them all burned alive. He then demanded that Katherine abjure her Christian faith and marry him, but she refused on the grounds that she was a bride of Christ. At this, the emperor's patience with her gave out, and she was beaten, imprisoned, and sentenced to be broken on a spiked wheel that had its two halves rotating in different directions. But just as her agony was about to begin, an angel appeared and smote the wheel with a sword, breaking it into pieces.<br><br>This miraculous intervention is said to have inspired the mass conversion of two thousand Roman soldiers, whereupon an even more enraged Maxentius had Katherine beheaded. Afterward, other angels appeared and miraculously carried her remains to Mount Sinai, where a Greek Orthodox monastery was built to house her shrine. It should be noted that there are<br>many variations on this fantastical tale.<br><br>Throughout the Middle Ages the cult of St. Katherine gained momentum. She was revered for her staunch faith, her courage, and her blessed virginity, and was believed to have under her special protection young maidens, churchmen, philosophers, students, craftsmen, nurses, and the dying.

Using a wide variety of local historical source materials, Moberg studies the ruthless monarch Vasa and his two tragic opponents: the psychopathic Christian II of Denmark and Nils Dracke, the leader of the Smalanders. Furthermore, he examines the enigmatic and wide appeal of the Swedish forest and investigates the origins of the Swedish hatred of Danes, which was implanted by propaganda through songs commissioned by Karl VIII&#39;s chancellery. Moberg&#39;s history has been widely hailed by the Swedish press as a masterpiece of popular history writing and has been an all-time best-seller in Swedish bookstores.</p><p>A revealing and entertaining account of Sweden&#39;s past - now in paperback!Vilhelm Moberg (1898-1972) was one of Sweden&#39;s greatest writers of the twentieth century and is well known for his remarkable The Emigrants (1949), a four-volume epic tale of Swedish immigration to America.

Even from the time of the Puritans, he reveals, America was no shining &#x201c;city up on a hill&#x201d; but an engine of commercial and territorial expansion that drove Native Americans, as well as French, Spanish, Russian, and ultimately even British power, from the North American continent. Even before the birth of the nation, Americans believed they were destined for global leadership. Underlying their ambitions, Kagan argues, was a set of ideas and ideals about the world and human nature. He focuses on the Declaration of Independence as the document that firmly established the American conviction that the inalienable rights of all mankind transcended territorial borders and blood ties. American nationalism, he shows, was always internationalist at its core. He also makes a startling discovery: that the Civil War and the abolition of slavery&#x2014;the fulfillment of the ideals of the Declaration&#x2014;were the decisive turning point in the history of American foreign policy as well. Kagan's brilliant and comprehensive reexamination of early American foreign policy makes clear why America, from its very beginning, has been viewed worldwide not only as a wellspring of political, cultural, and social revolution, but as an ambitious and, at times, dangerous nation.</p><p><b>Robert Kagan </b>is senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund, and a columnist for <i>The Washington Post</i>.

She is not made for herself only, but given as a magistrate of God unto mankind, for the vindication of common right and the law of nature. Wherefore saith Cicero of the . . . Romans, Nos magis patronatum orbis terrarrum suscepimus quam imperium, we have rather undertaken the patronage than the empire of the world.</i> &#x2014;James Harrington, <i>The Commonwealth of Oceana</i>, 1656<br>The Myth of the &#x201c;City upon a Hill&#x201d;: The Americanization of the Puritan Mission<br>Misperceptions about the history, traditions, and nature of American foreign policy begin with the popular image of the Puritans who settled in New England in the 1630s. John Winthrop&#x2019;s hopeful description of the Massachusetts Bay theocracy as a &#x201c;city upon a hill&#x201d; is emblazoned in the American self-image, a vivid symbol of what are widely seen as dominant isolationist and &#x201c;exceptionalist&#x201d; tendencies in American foreign policy. The Puritan &#x201c;mission,&#x201d; as the historian Frederick Merk once put it, was &#x201c;to redeem the Old World by high example,&#x201d; and generations of Americans have considered this &#x201c;exemplarist&#x201d; purpose the country&#x2019;s original mission in its pure, uncorrupted form: the desire to set an example to the world, but from a safe distance.1 Felix Gilbert argued that the unique combination of idealism and isolationism in American thought derived from the Puritans&#x2019; &#x201c;utopian&#x201d; aspirations, which required &#x201c;separation&#x201d; from Europe and the severing of &#x201c;ties which might spread the diseases of Europe to America.&#x201d;2 The true American &#x201c;mission,&#x201d; therefore, was inherently isolationist, passive, and restrained; it was, as Merk put it, both &#x201c;idealistic&#x201d; and &#x201c;self-denying . . . a force that fought to curb expansionism of the aggressive variety.&#x201d;3<br><br>This picture of Puritan America as a pious Greta Garbo, wanting only to be left alone in her self-contained world, is misleading. For one thing, Winthrop&#x2019;s Puritans were not isolationists. They were global revolutionaries.4 They escaped persecution in the Old World to establish the ideal religious commonwealth in America, their &#x201c;new Jerusalem.&#x201d; But unlike the biblical Jews, they looked forward to the day, they hoped not far off, when they might return to a reformed Egypt. Far from seeking permanent separation from the Old World, the Puritans&#x2019; &#x201c;errand into the wilderness&#x201d; aimed to establish a base from which to launch a counteroffensive across the Atlantic. Their special covenant with God was not tied to the soil of the North American continent.5 America was not the Puritans&#x2019; promised land but a temporary refuge.6 God had &#x201c;peopled New England in order that the reformation of England and Scotland may be hastened.&#x201d;7 As the great scholar of Puritan thought Perry Miller explained many years ago, the Puritan migration &#x201c;was no retreat from Europe: it was a flank attack.&#x201d; The &#x201c;large unspoken assumption in the errand of 1630&#x201d; was that success in New England would mean a return to old England.8<br><br>The Massachusetts Bay colonists neither sought isolation from the Old World nor considered themselves isolated.9 The Puritan leaders did not even believe they were establishing a &#x201c;new&#x201d; world distinct from the old. In their minds New England and Old England were the same world, spiritually if not geographically. A hundred years after Winthrop&#x2019;s settlement, when the Puritan evangelist Jonathan Edwards spoke of &#x201c;our nation,&#x201d; he meant both Britain and the British North American colonies. It was a measure of how little the New England Puritans sought isolation from the Old World that their greatest disappointment came when England&#x2019;s Puritan revolution in the mid-seventeenth century abandoned rigid Calvinism, the Puritans&#x2019; model, thus leaving the Puritans theologically isolated in their American wilderness.10<br><br>America, in turn, became not a promised land but a burial ground for the kind of Puritan theocracy Winthrop and his followers had hoped to establish. Puritanism died in part because the American wilderness, like the biblical Israel, was a land of milk and honey. The New World was too vast for the Puritans&#x2019; worldly asceticism. Their rigid theocracy required control and obedience and self-restraint, but the expansive North American wilderness created freedom, dissent, independence, and the lust for land. The abundance of land and economic opportunities for men and women of all social stations diverted too many minds from godly to worldly pursuits. It undermined patriarchal hierarchy and shattered orthodoxy. Those who did not like the way the doctrines of Calvinism were construed and enforced in the Massachusetts Bay Colony had only to move up the Connecticut Valley. Within a dozen years after Winthrop&#x2019;s arrival, Puritan divines were decrying their parishioners&#x2019; sinful desire for ever more &#x201c;elbow-room&#x201d; in their New World. &#x201c;Land! Land! hath been the Idol of many in New-England,&#x201d; cried Increase Mather. &#x201c;They that profess themselves Christians, have foresaken Churches, and Ordinances, and all for land and elbow-room enough in the World.&#x201d;11<br><br>The rich lands of North America also helped unleash liberal, materialist forces within Protestantism that overwhelmed the Puritan fathers&#x2019; original godly vision and brought New England onto the path on which the rest of British-American civilization was already traveling: toward individualism, progress, and modernity. With so many opportunities for personal enrichment available in the New World, the &#x201c;Protestant ethic,&#x201d; as Max Weber called it, which countenanced the rewards of labor as a sign of God&#x2019;s favor and which demanded hard work in one&#x2019;s &#x201c;calling&#x201d; as a sign of election, became a powerful engine of material progress. In a short time, settlers, plantation owners, and the increasingly prosperous and powerful merchants of Boston&#x2014;the so-called River Gods&#x2014;came to worship at altars other than those of their Calvinist fathers and grandfathers. The liberal, commercial ethos of these new mercantile groups represented the spirit of a new age, whose &#x201c;guiding principles were not social stability, order, and the discipline of the senses, but mobility, growth, and the enjoyment of life.&#x201d;12<br><br>By the early eighteenth century Puritan New England had entered &#x201c;the emerging secular and commercial culture&#x201d; of Anglo-America. The New Englanders &#x201c;relinquished their grand vision of building a city upon a hill,&#x201d; and Puritanism itself melted into the new, modernizing society.13 The burst of religious revivalism in the early to mid-eighteenth century, termed the Great Awakening, was a monument to Puritanism&#x2019;s failure, a worried response to the increasing secularization of American society and to the spread of Christian rationalism and Deism among colonial elites. From its original pious ambitions, Jonathan Edwards lamented, the Puritans&#x2019; America had fallen into sin. History had never witnessed &#x201c;such a casting off [of] the Christian religion,&#x201d; nor &#x201c;so much scoffing at and ridiculing the gospel of Christ by those that have been brought up under gospel light.&#x201d;14 Even Edwards&#x2019;s own reactionary revivalism was shaped by the new realities of life in an expansive, modernizing, and free America, for his was a democratized, antihierarchical Puritanism that conformed to the increasingly fluid nature of colonial American society. His effort to stem the tide of liberalism and modernity was futile. As Edwards wrote his treatises on faith and salvation and obedience to God, his fellow British colonials were &#x201c;beginning to think of themselves as having individual rights that were self-evidently endowments of nature.&#x201d;15 By the last quarter of the eighteenth century a foreign observer like the French immigrant Michel-Guillaume-Jean de Cr�vecoeur could write of Americans that they &#x201c;think more of the affairs of this world than of those of the next.&#x201d;16<br><br>Not only has the original Puritan mission often been misunderstood, therefore, but the rapid absorption and dissipation of Puritanism within the mainstream of colonial American society meant that the Puritan influence in shaping the character of that society, and its foreign policies, was not as great as has sometimes been imagined. Most of America outside of New England had never been under Puritan influence, and by the early eighteenth century even New England was no Puritan commonwealth but a rising center of liberalism and commercialism. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries it was the southern and middle colonies, not New England, that &#x201c;epitomized what was arguably the most important element in the emerging British-American culture: the conception of America as a place in which free people could pursue their own individual happiness in safety and with a fair prospect that they might be successful in their several quests.&#x201d;17<br><br>The society and culture that took root in the Chesapeake Bay region had far greater influence on the evolution of American society, and therefore on American foreign policy, than did Puritanism. This colonial America was characterized not by isolationism and utopianism, not by cities upon hills and covenants with God, but by aggressive expansionism, acquisitive materialism, and an overarching ideology of civilization that encouraged and justified both. In Virginia and the other settlements along the Chesapeake Bay that predated the Puritans&#x2019; arrival in New England, the dreams that drew Englishmen to a rough and untamed country were of wealth and opportunity, not...</p><h2>Triple: A Novel</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel of international suspense and terror from the author of <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, <i>World Without End</i>, and <i>A Column of Fire<br></i></b><br> As Egypt comes closer and closer to developing a nuclear bomb, the Mossad&#x2019;s number one Israeli agent is given an impossible mission: to beat the Arabs in the nuclear arms race by finding and stealing two hundred tons of uranium.

His designs for typography, books, posters, murals, and magazines have remained relatively obscure, even though they are key components of his oeuvre. <p>Penny Fowler has thoroughly investigated the artist's innovative graphic work and placed it within the context of various aesthetic movements, from Arts and Crafts to Bauhaus and De Stijl. Wright's publications - including The House Beautiful and An Autobiography - his delineations for the Wasmuth Portfolio, and his mural designs for Midway Gardens and the Imperial Hotel are explored, and one chapter is devoted to the festive covers Wright created for Liberty magazine. (Wright's designs were considered far too radical from the current trends, so Liberty turned them down.) </p><p>Now this important part of the artist's work has been succinctly reviewed and amply illustrated. The ten chapters - carefully annotated with endnotes - explore Wright's foray into the world of graphic design, including book design; his influence by international sources; and his visits to Japan and Europe. Exhibitions and publications are included in the last chapter.

Though most people know of him only for the famous Pythagorean Theorem (a2 +b2=c2), in fact the pillars of our scientific tradition&#x2015;belief that the universe is rational, that there is unity to all things, and that numbers and mathematics are a powerful guide to truth about nature and the cosmos&#x2015;hark back to the convictions of this legendary sixth-century B.C. scholar.<br>Born around 570 B.C. on the cultured Aegean island of Samos, Pythagoras (according to ancient tales) studied with the sage Thales nearby at Miletus, and with priests and scribes in Egypt and Babylon. Eventually he founded his own school at Croton in southern Italy, where he and his followers began to unravel the surprising deep truths concealed behind such ordinary tasks as tuning a lyre. While considering why some string lengths produced beautiful sounds and others discordant ones, they uncovered the ratios of musical harmony, and recognized that hidden behind the confusion and complexity of nature are patterns and orderly relationships. They had surprised the Creator at his drafting board and had glimpsed the mind of God! Some of them later would also find something darker in numbers and nature: irrationality, a revelation so unsettling and subversive that it may have contributed to the destruction of their brotherhood.</p><p>Praised for her ability to illuminate complex subjects, Kitty Ferguson brilliantly evokes the archaic world of Pythagoras, showing how ideas spread in antiquity, chronicling the influence he and his followers have had on so many extraordinary people in the history of Western thought and science, and bringing a poignant human saga to readers who are daily reminded that harmony and chaos can and do coexist.</p></p><p><b>Kitty Ferguson</b> is the author of <i>Tycho &amp; Kepler</i>, <i>Measuring the Universe</i>, <i>The Fire in the Equations</i>, and <i>Stephen Hawking: Quest for a Theory of Everything</i>.

But from its origins in the writings of the Stoics, the first thoroughgoing materialists, another view has acknowledged that no forms of materialism can be completely self-inclusive&#x2015;space, time, the void, and sense are the incorporeal conditions of all that is corporeal or material. In <i>The Incorporeal</i> Elizabeth Grosz argues that the ideal is inherent in the material and the material in the ideal, and, by tracing its development over time, she makes the case that this same idea reasserts itself in different intellectual contexts.<br><br>Grosz shows that not only are idealism and materialism inextricably linked but that this "belonging together" of the entirety of ideality and the entirety of materiality is not mediated or created by human consciousness. Instead, it is an ontological condition for the development of human consciousness. Grosz draws from Spinoza's material and ideal concept of substance, Nietzsche's <i>amor fati</i>, Deleuze and Guattari's plane of immanence, Simondon's preindividual, and Raymond Ruyer's self-survey or autoaffection to show that the world preexists the evolution of the human and that its material and incorporeal forces are the conditions for all forms of life, human and nonhuman alike. A masterwork by an eminent theoretician, <i>The Incorporeal</i> offers profound new insight into the mind-body problem</p><p>Elizabeth Grosz explores the idea that the ideal is inherent or immanent in the material and the material in the ideal. She also traces how that concept has been developed by subsequent philosophers, arguing that the same idea reasserts itself in different intellectual contexts throughout history. Grosz shows that, far from being mutually exclusive, idealism and materialism are inextricably linked and that this belonging together of the entirety of ideality and the entirety of materiality is not mediated or created by human consciousness but is an ontological condition for the development of human consciousness.Elizabeth Grosz is the Jean Fox O'Barr Professor in Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies and Literature at Duke University.

But these tactics often are not effective. A better approach to spread Christ&#x2019;s word, Dallas Willard suggests, is to use the example of our own lives. To demonstrate Jesus&#x2019;s message, we must be transformed people living out a life reflective of Jesus himself, a life of love, humility, and gentleness.</p><p>This beautiful model of life&#x2014;this allure of gentleness&#x2014;Willard argues, is the foundation for making the most compelling argument for Christianity, one that will convince others that there is something special about Christianity and the Jesus we follow.</p><p></p></p><p><p>When called upon to explain their faith, Christians do not always feel equipped to do so&#x2014;particularly when some of the most difficult questions arise. In <em>The Allure of Gentleness</em>, esteemed teacher and author Dallas Willard not only assures us of the truth and reasonableness of the Christian faith, but also explores why reason and logic are not enough: to explain Jesus's message, we must also be like Jesus, characterized by love, humility, and gentleness.</p><p>Based on a series of talks and lectures on apologetics given by the late author and edited by his daughter, Becky Heatley, this book constitutes Dallas Willard's most thorough presentation on how to defend the Christian faith for the twenty-first century.

For eighteenth-century Europeans, the Lisbon earthquake was manifest evil. Today we view evil as a matter of human cruelty, and Auschwitz as its extreme incarnation. Examining our understanding of evil from the Inquisition to contemporary terrorism, Susan Neiman explores who we have become in the three centuries that separate us from the early Enlightenment. In the process, she rewrites the history of modern thought and points philosophy back to the questions that originally animated it.</p><p>Whether expressed in theological or secular terms, evil poses a problem about the world's intelligibility. It confronts philosophy with fundamental questions: Can there be meaning in a world where innocents suffer? Can belief in divine power or human progress survive a cataloging of evil? Is evil profound or banal? Neiman argues that these questions impelled modern philosophy. Traditional philosophers from Leibniz to Hegel sought to defend the Creator of a world containing evil. Inevitably, their efforts--combined with those of more literary figures like Pope, Voltaire, and the Marquis de Sade--eroded belief in God's benevolence, power, and relevance, until Nietzsche claimed He had been murdered. They also yielded the distinction between natural and moral evil that we now take for granted. Neiman turns to consider philosophy's response to the Holocaust as a final moral evil, concluding that two basic stances run through modern thought. One, from Rousseau to Arendt, insists that morality demands we make evil intelligible. The other, from Voltaire to Adorno, insists that morality demands that we don't.</p><p>Beautifully written and thoroughly engaging, this book tells the history of modern philosophy as an attempt to come to terms with evil. It reintroduces philosophy to anyone interested in questions of life and death, good and evil, suffering and sense.</p></p><p><br><p>"This is a splendid book; it will be widely read and much discussed. Working from the assumption that philosophers ought to attend to 'the questions that brought us here,' Susan Neiman has given us a brilliant reading of those who have done just that. Her history of philosophy is also a philosophical argument: that evil is the central question driving the best modern philosophy, and that it is not only a moral question but a metaphysical one. The book is written with grace and wit; again and again, Neiman writes the kind of sentences we dream of uttering in the perfect conversation: where every mot is bon. This is exemplary philosophy."<b>--Michael Walzer</b><br></p><br><p>"A brilliant study of changes in our understanding of evil from the book of Job through the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and on to the Holocaust and September 11. Neiman makes a powerful case for taking that problem as central to the history of modern philosophy, and her analysis of our present resources for coping with evil are provocative as well as profound. It's an immensely illuminating book."<b>--J. B. Schneewind</b><br></p><br><p>"In tracing the responses to the problem of evil from the Enlightenment, when the question was why the Lisbon earthquake and the engag�s were Voltaire, Leibniz, Pope, and Rousseau, to the present, when it is why Auschwitz and they are Am�ry, Arendt, Camus, and Adorno, Neiman has made an original and powerful contribution to the analysis of an intractable moral issue: how to live with the fact that neither God nor nature seems concerned with our fate. Succinctly, steadily, and relentlessly written, the history of philosophy as philosophy could hardly be better done."<b>--Clifford Geertz</b><br></p><br><p>"Even--or especially--to a nonphilosopher like myself, Susan Neiman's <i>Evil in Modern Thought</i> offers intellectual adventure of a high order. The audacity of her recasting of Western philosophy is matched by its profundity--and frequent wit. Its challenges are as bracing as they are essential. Her intellectual fearlessness deserves the closest and widest attention."<b>--Todd Gitlin</b><br></p><br><b>Susan Neiman</b> is Director of the Einstein Forum, Potsdam.

It destroys the lives of individuals, and has a devastating cost to society. The National Institute of Health estimates seventeen million adults in the United States are alcoholics or have a serious problem with alcohol. At the same time, the country is seeing entire communities brought to their knees because of opioid additions. These scourges affect not only those who drink or use drugs but also their families and friends, who witness the horror of addiction. <i>With&nbsp;Out of the Wreck I Rise</i>,&nbsp;Neil Steinberg and Sara Bader have created a resource like no other&#x2014;one that harnesses the power of literature, poetry, and creativity to illuminate what alcoholism and addiction are all about, while forging change, deepening understanding, and even saving lives.<br> Structured to follow the arduous steps to sobriety, the book marshals the wisdom of centuries and explores essential topics, including the importance of time, navigating family and friends, relapse, and what Raymond Carver calls &#x201c;gravy,&#x201d; the reward that is recovery. Each chapter begins with advice and commentary followed by a wealth of quotes to inspire and heal. The result is a mosaic of observations and encouragement that draws on writers and artists spanning thousands of years&#x2014;from Seneca to David Foster Wallace, William Shakespeare to Patti Smith. The ruminations of notorious drinkers like John Cheever, Charles Bukowski, and Ernest Hemingway shed light on the difficult process of becoming sober and remind the reader that while the literary alcoholic is often romanticized, recovery is the true path of the hero.<br> Along with traditional routes to recovery&#x2014;Alcoholics Anonymous, out-patient therapy, and intensive rehabilitation programs&#x2014;this literary companion offers valuable support and inspiration to anyone seeking to fight their addiction or to a struggling loved one.<br><br> Featuring Charles Bukowski, John Cheever, Dante, Ricky Gervais, Ernest Hemingway, Billie Holiday, Anne Lamott, John Lennon, Haruki Murakami, Ana�s Nin, Mary Oliver, Samuel Pepys, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.

Between April 1942 and October 1943, about 250,000 Jews from European countries and the Soviet Union were sent to the Nazi death camp at Sobib�r in occupied Poland. Sobib�r was not a transit camp or work camp: its sole purpose was efficient mass murder. On October 14, 1943, approximately half of the 650 or so prisoners still alive at Sobib�r undertook a daring and precisely planned revolt, killing SS officers and fleeing through minefields and machine-gun fire into the surrounding forests, farms, and towns. Only about forty-two of them, including Fiszel, are known to have survived to the end of the war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Philip (Fiszel) Bialowitz, now an American citizen, tells his eyewitness story here in the real-time perspective of his own boyhood, from his childhood before the war and his internment in the brutal Izbica ghetto to his harrowing six months at Sobib�r&#x2014;including his involvement in the revolt and desperate mass escape&#x2014;and his rescue by courageous Polish farmers. He also recounts the challenges of life following the war as a teenaged displaced person, and his eventual efforts as a witness to the truth of the Holocaust.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1943 the heroic leaders of the revolt at Sobib�r, Sasha Perchersky and Leon Feldhendler, implored fellow prisoners to promise that anyone who survived would tell the story of Sobib�r: not just of the horrific atrocities committed there, but of the courage and humanity of those who fought back. Bialowitz has kept that promise.</p><p><br>Best Books for General Audiences, selected by the American Association for School Libraries</p><p><br>Best Books for High Schools, selected by the American Association for School Libraries</p><p><br>Best Books for Special Interests, selected by the Public Library Association</p></p><p><p>Philip (Fiszel) Bialowitz (1925&#x2013;2016) was a retired jeweler. He frequently spoke in North America and Europe about his experience at Sobib�r, including testifying at several war crimes trials, most recently at the German trial of John Demjanjuk in 2010.&nbsp;Joseph Bialowitz is Philip&#x2019;s son. He is an environmental manager and Holocaust lecturer who lives in California.</p>Most of the Nazi concentration camps were brutal slave-labor facilities, in which the deaths resulted from disease, malnutrition, and the sheer brutality of daily life. Sobibor, on the other hand, was designed from inception as an extermination camp. Located within a forested area in Poland, Sobibor had a full array of sophisticated equipment for mass murder, and an estimated 250,000 Jews were killed there in 1942 and 1943. In October 1943, camp inmates revolted, killing guards and staging a mass escape. Few of them survived. Philip Bialowitz, now a retired jeweler living in New York, was one of them. His story, told with the aid of his son Joseph, is riveting, horrifying, and inspiring. Philip&#x2019;s life in a tiny Polish town before the Nazi invasion was tolerable but tense due to touchy relations between the Jewish and gentile communities. Life in Sobibor is vividly described as hell on earth, and the violent revolt provides an almost joyful emotional release as Jews strike back at their tormentors. This is a superb account of survival and redemption as seen through the eyes of a teenage boy. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Berto y sus buenas ideas (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Berto is an eleven-year-old boy who lives in Madrid, Spain.

In propulsive three-line stanzas, he tells the story of how a once unstoppable child, who suffered from various developmental disorders, turned into an irreverent young adult, funny, rebellious, impulsive. Hirsch mixes his tale of Gabriel with the stories of other poets through the centuries who have also lost children, and expresses his feelings through theirs. His landmark poem enters the broad stream of human grief and raises in us the strange hope, even consolation, that we find in the writer&#x2019;s act of witnessing and transformation.

It dispels the popular belief that the pattern of the land is a result of 18th-century enclosures and attributes it instead to a much longer evolution. This book traces the chronological development of the English landscape from pre-Roman days to the eve of the Black Death, onwards to the Industrial Revolution and up to the present day. With the help of photographs and charts, Professor Hopkins discusses the origins of Devonshire hedge-banks and lanes, the ruined churches in Norfolk and lost villages in Lincolnshire, Somerset&#39;s marshland ditches, Cornwall&#39;s remote granite farmsteads and the lonely pastures of upland Northamptonshire.</p><p></p><h2>Meeting the Expectations of the Land: Essays in Sustainable Agriculture and Stewardship</h2><p>A collection of essays examines agricultural techniques designed to meet the needs of the people without depleting the land</p><p></p><h2>The Girl in the Glass Box: A Jack Swyteck Novel (Jack Swyteck Novel, 15)</h2><p><p>Miami attorney Jack Swyteck lands in the heart of the contentious immigration debate when he takes on the heart-wrenching case of an undocumented immigrant who fled to America to protect her daughter and save herself, in this timely and pulse-pounding thriller that explores the stories behind the headlines from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author James Grippando, winner of the Harper Lee Prize for Legal Fiction.</p><p>Julia Rodriguez and her teenage daughter Beatriz escaped bloodthirsty gangs, random violence and, Julia's abusive husband back in El Salvador.

His best legmen (and women) are folks he knows from the kinds of bars the tourist board doesn't acknowledge, and they live wherever they can - including the streets. It makes sense: They're virtually invisible.<br>With all that going for him, it's no wonder that Waterman receives the kind of call he can't refuse from aging mobster Tim Flood. Tim's granddaughter, Caroline, is involved in something and she won't talk about it. Beautiful, willful, and her grandfather's kin, she's been able to get around anyone he's sent after her.<br>So, Leo gets his marching orders: Bring Caroline home. Safe.<br>Unfortunately, the crowd she's running with has its own agenda ... and Caroline really does want to do something about the environment....</p><p>Just out in paperback, Ford&#39;s jaunty first mystery introduces a Seattle sleuth called Leo Waterman -- the rebellious scion of a powerful family who carries the spirit of the &#39;60s around with him like dirty laundry.

Nas&#x2019; maturation at the hands of immortal organic farm/commune rehabber River has not compromised her sarcastic, self-deprecating sense of humor, and the erratic steamy romance with Viking Reyn will keep readers turning pages.

His path-breaking research has received extensive media coverage, including features in <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i>, and he has appeared on <i>Dateline</i>, <i>20/20</i>, the <i>Today</i> show, and <i>CBS This Morning</i>. His books include <i>The Evolution of Desire</i> and <i>The Dangerous Passion</i>.My research into murder began in earnest after an astonishing experience with one of my classes of undergraduates. Six years ago, I taught a seminar on human nature that included a session on murder. As an exercise to get the class engaged, I had the students complete a questionnaire asking &#x201c;Have you ever thought about killing someone?&#x201d; If the answer turned out to be yes, students were instructed to describe the specific circumstances that had triggered their homicidal thought, their relationship to the victim, and the method of killing that they had fantasized about. <p>As I read through their responses back in my office, I became mesmerized. Nothing had prepared me for the outpouring of murderous thoughts my students reported. These were intelligent, well-scrubbed, mostly middle-class kids, not the gang members or troubled runaways one might expect to express violent rage, yet most of them had experienced at least one intense episode in which they had fantasized about killing someone. As I sat in my office analyzing these homicidal fantasies, I realized that carried-out kills were just the tips of the deep psychological iceberg. Could actual murder be only the most flagrant outcome of a fundamental human drive to kill? I wondered. Do our minds really course with homicidal thoughts? </p><p>Pursuing this line of research, my lab went on to conduct the largest scientific study ever carried out on why people have homicidal fantasies, and the specific circumstances in which they contemplate killing. This groundbreaking international study involved more than four thousand individuals from San Antonio to Singapore, who were interviewed intensively. According to our findings, 91 percent of men and 84 percent of women have had at least one vivid fantasy about killing someone. The answer appeared to be, yes, our minds do pulse with thoughts of murder. </p><p>As I contemplated this finding, with the knowledge that the human mind has been exquisitely finely tuned by evolution, I began to suspect that these fantasies were the expressions of deep psychological mechanisms&#x2014;of evolutionary programming&#x2014;predisposing us to kill. Six years of near-obsessive subsequent research has led me to the conclusion that yes, the human mind is indeed hard-wired for killing, and that all the many kinds of murder&#x2014;from crimes of passion to the methodically planned contract kill&#x2014;follow the same deeply ingrained impulses. There is a fundamental logic to murder, which is ruthless but rational. </p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Truth about Bats (The Magic School Bus Chapter Book, No. 1)</h2><p>These books combine fun stories with neat facts, humor, illustrations-and they all feature the fabulous Ms. Fizzle! <br></p><p>My name is Ralphie.

Out of power, exiled to the eastern Mediterranean with his faithful secretary, Tiro, separated from his wife and children, his possessions confiscated, he spends his days tormented by his failure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to quote one of his own famous aphorisms: 'while there's life there's hope'. By promising to support his political enemy, Caesar, he manages to win his return to Italy. Once home, he gradually fights his way back: first in the law courts, then in the senate, and finally by the power of his pen, until at last, for one brief and glorious period, he is once again the dominant figure in Rome.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-awaited final volume of Robert Harris's Cicero Trilogy, <i>Dictator </i>encompasses some of the most epic events in human history: the collapse of the Roman republic, the subsequent civil war, the murder of Pompey and the assassination of Julius Caesar. Its theme, however, is timeless: how is political freedom to be safeguarded against the triple threats of unscrupulous personal ambition, of an electoral system dominated by vested financial interests, and of the corrupting impact of waging ceaseless foreign wars?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But above all, it is the very human figure of Cicero, beset by family problems, which makes the story so compelling: brilliant, flawed, frequently fearful and yet ultimately brave -- a hero for his time, and for ours.</p><p><p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of <i>An Officer and a Spy, Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, Lustrum, </i>and <i>The Ghost</i>, all of which were international bestsellers. His work has been translated into thirty-seven languages. After graduating with a degree in English from Cambridge University, he worked as a reporter for the BBC's Panorama and Newsnight programmes, before becoming political editor of the <i>Observer</i> and subsequently a columnist on the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. He is married to Gill Hornby and they live with their four children in a village near Hungerford.</p>I<br><br>I remember the cries of caesar&#x2019;s war-horns chasing us over the darkened fields of Latium&#x2014;their yearning, keening howls, like animals in heat&#x2014;and how when they stopped there was only the slither of our shoes on the icy road and the urgent panting of our breath.<br><br>It was not enough for the immortal gods that Cicero should be spat at and reviled by his fellow citizens; not enough that in the middle of the night he be driven from the hearths and altars of his family and ancestors; not enough even that as we fled from Rome on foot he should look back and see his house in flames. To all these torments they deemed it necessary to add one further refinement: that he should be forced to hear his enemy&#x2019;s army striking camp on the Field of Mars.<br><br>Even though he was the oldest of our party Cicero kept up the same fast pace as the rest of us. Not long ago he had held Caesar&#x2019;s life in the palm of his hand. He could have crushed it as easily as an egg. Now their fortunes led them in entirely opposite directions. While Cicero hurried south to escape his enemies, the architect of his destruction marched north to take command of both provinces of Gaul.<br><br>He walked with his head down, not uttering a word and I imagined it was because he was too full of despair to speak. Only at dawn, when we rendezvoused with our horses at Bovillae and were about to embark on the second stage of our escape, did he pause with his foot in the doorway of his carriage and say suddenly, &#x201c;Do you think we should turn back?&#x201d;<br><br>The question caught me by surprise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t considered it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, consider it now. Tell me: why are we fleeing Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is Clodius so powerful?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s a tribune and can pass laws against you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who made it possible for him to become a tribune?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. &#x201c;Caesar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Caesar. Do you imagine that man&#x2019;s departure for Gaul at that precise hour was a coincidence? Of course not! He waited till his spies had reported I&#x2019;d left the city before ordering his army to move. Why? I&#x2019;d always assumed his advancement of Clodius was to punish me for speaking out against him. But what if his real aim all along was to drive me out of Rome? What scheme requires him to be certain I&#x2019;ve gone before he can leave too?&#x201d;<br><br>I should have grasped the logic of what he was saying. I should have urged him to turn back. But I was too exhausted to reason clearly. And if I am honest there was more to it than that. I was too afraid of what Clodius&#x2019;s thugs might do to us if they caught us re-entering the city.<br><br>So instead I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good question, and I can&#x2019;t pretend I have the answer. But wouldn&#x2019;t it look indecisive, after bidding goodbye to everyone, suddenly to reappear? In any case, Clodius has burned your house down now&#x2014;where would we return to? Who would take us in? I think you&#x2019;d be wiser to stick to your original plan and get as far away from Rome as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He rested his head against the side of the carriage and closed his eyes. In the pale grey light I was shocked by how haggard he appeared after his night on the road. His hair and beard had not been cut for weeks. He was wearing a toga dyed black. Although he was only in his forty-ninth year, these public signs of mourning made him look much older&#x2014;like some ancient, mendicant holy man. After a while he sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Tiro. Perhaps you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s so long since I slept I&#x2019;m too tired to think any more.&#x201d;<br><br>And so the fatal error was made&#x2014;more through indecision than decision&#x2014;and we continued to press on southwards for the remainder of that day and for the twelve days that followed, putting what we thought was a safe distance between ourselves and danger.<br><br>We travelled with a minimal entourage to avoid attracting attention&#x2014;just the carriage driver and three armed slaves on horseback, one in front and two behind. A small chest of gold and silver coins that Atticus, Cicero&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had provided to pay for our journey was hidden under our seat. We stayed only in the houses of men we trusted, no more than a night in each, and steered clear of those places where Cicero might have been expected to stop&#x2014;for example at his seaside villa at Formiae, the first place any pursuers would look for him, and along the Bay of Naples, already filling with the annual exodus from Rome in search of winter sun and warm springs. Instead we headed as fast as we could towards the toe of Italy.<br><br>Cicero&#x2019;s plan, conceived on the move, was to make for Sicily and stay there until the political agitation against him in Rome subsided. &#x201c;The mob will turn on Clodius eventually,&#x201d; he predicted. &#x201c;Such is the unalterable nature of the mob. He will always be my mortal enemy but he won&#x2019;t always be tribune&#x2014;we must never forget that. In nine months his term of office will expire and then we can go back.&#x201d;<br><br>He was confident of a friendly reception from the Sicilians, if only because of his successful prosecution of the island&#x2019;s tyrannical governor, Verres&#x2014;even though that brilliant victory, which launched his political career, was now twelve years in the past and Clodius had more recently been a magistrate in the province. I sent letters ahead giving notice of his intention to seek sanctuary, and when we reached the harbour at Regium we hired a little six-oared boat to row us across the straits to Messina.<br><br>We left the harbour on a clear cold winter morning of searing blues&#x2014;the sea and the sky; one light, one dark; the line dividing them as sharp as a blade; the distance to Messina a mere three miles. It took us less than an hour. We drew so close we could see Cicero&#x2019;s supporters lined up on the rocks to welcome him. But stationed between us and the entrance to the port was a warship flying the red and green colours of the governor of Sicily, Gaius Vergilius, and as we approached the lighthouse it slipped its anchor and moved slowly forwards to intercept us. Vergilius stood at the rail surrounded by his lictors and, after visibly recoiling at Cicero&#x2019;s dishevelled appearance, shouted down a greeting, to which Cicero replied in friendly terms. They had known one another in the Senate for many years.<br><br>Vergilius asked him his intentions.<br><br>Cicero called back that naturally he intended to come ashore.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d heard,&#x201d; replied Vergilius. &#x201c;Unhappily I can&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius&#x2019;s new law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what new law would that be? There are so many, one loses count.&#x201d;<br><br>Vergilius beckoned to a member of his staff who produced a document and leaned down to pass it to me and I then gave it to Cicero. To this day I can remember how it fluttered in his hands in the slight breeze as if it were a living thing; it was the only sound in the silence. He took his time and when he had finished reading it he handed it to me without comment.<br><br>Lex Clodia in Ciceronem<br><br>Whereas M. T. Cicero has put Roman citizens to death unheard and uncondemned; and to that end forged the authority and decree of the Senate; it is hereby ordained that he be interdicted from fire and water to a distance of four hundred miles from Rome; that nobody should presume to harbour or receive him, on pain of death; that all his property and possessions be forfeit; that his house in Rome be demolished and a shrine to Liberty consecrated in its place; and that whoever shall move, speak, vote or take any step towards recalling him shall be treated as a public enemy, unless those whom Cicero unlawfully put to death should first spring back to life.<br><br>It must have been the most terrible blow. But he found the composure to dismiss it with a flick of his hand. &#x201c;When,&#x201d; he enquired, &#x201c;was this nonsense published?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told it was posted in Rome eight days ago. It came into my hands yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s not law yet, and can&#x2019;t be law until it&#x2019;s been read a third time. My secretary will confirm it. Tiro,&#x201d; he said, turning to me, &#x201c;tell the governor the earliest date it can be passed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to calculate. Before a bill could be put to a vote it had to be read aloud in the Forum on three successive market days. But my reasoning was so shaken by what I had just read I couldn&#x2019;t remember what day of the week it was now, let alone when the market days fell. &#x201c;Twenty days from today,&#x201d; I hazarded, &#x201c;perhaps twenty-five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; cried Cicero. &#x201c;I have three weeks&#x2019; grace even if it passes, which I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He stood up in the prow of the boat, bracing his legs against the rocking of the hull, and spread his arms wide in appeal. &#x201c;Please, my dear Vergilius, for the sake of our past friendship, now that I have come so far, at least allow me to land and spend a night or two with my supporters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, as I say, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I cannot take the risk. I&#x2019;ve consulted my experts. They say even if you travelled to the very western tip of the island, to Lilybaeum, you&#x2019;d still be within three hundred and fifty miles of Rome, and then Clodius would come after me.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Cicero ceased to be so friendly. He said coldly, &#x201c;You have no right under the law to impede the journey of a Roman citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have every right to safeguard the tranquillity of my province. And here, as you know, my word is the law . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He was apologetic. I dare say he was even embarrassed. But he was immovable, and after a few more angry exchanges there was nothing for it but to turn round and row back to Regium. Our departure provoked a great cry of dismay from the shoreline and I could see that Cicero for the first time was seriously worried. Vergilius was a friend of his. If this was how a friend reacted then soon the whole of Italy would be closed against him. Returning to Rome to oppose the law was much too risky. He had left it too late. Apart from the physical danger such a journey would entail, the bill would almost certainly pass, and then we would be stranded four hundred miles from the legal limit it prescribed. To comply safely with the terms of his exile he would have to flee abroad immediately. Obviously Gaul was out of the question because of Caesar. So it would have to be somewhere in the East&#x2014;Greece perhaps, or Asia. But unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the peninsula to make our escape in the treacherous winter seas. We needed to get over to the opposite coast, to Brundisium on the Adriatic, and find a big ship capable of making a lengthy voyage. Our predicament was exquisitely vile&#x2014;as no doubt Caesar, the original sponsor and creator of Clodius, had intended.<br><br>it took us two weeks of arduous travel to cross the mountains, often in heavy rain and mostly along bad roads. Every mile seemed fraught with the hazard of ambush, although the primi�tive little towns we passed through were welcoming enough. At night we slept in smoky, freezing inns and dined on hard bread and fatty meat made scarcely more palatable by sour wine. Cicero&#x2019;s mood veered between fury and despair. He saw clearly now that he had made a terrible mistake by leaving Rome. It had been madness for him to quit the city and leave Clodius free to spread the calumny that he had put citizens to death &#x201c;unheard and uncondemned&#x201d; when in fact each of the five Catiline conspirators had been allowed to speak in his own defence and their execution had been sanctioned by the entire Senate. But his flight was tantamount to an admission of guilt. He should have obeyed his instinct and turned back when he heard Caesar&#x2019;s departing trumpets and first began to realise his error. He wept at the disaster his folly and timidity had brought upon his wife and children.<br><br>And when he had finished lashing himself, he turned his scourge on Hortensius &#x201c;and the rest of the aristocratic gang,&#x201d; who had never forgiven him for rising from his humble origins to the consulship and saving the republic: they had deliberately urged him to flee in order to ruin him. He should have heeded the example of Socrates, who said that death was preferable to exile. Yes, he should have killed himself! He snatched up a knife from the dining table. He would kill himself! I said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t take the threat seriously. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the sight of others&#x2019; blood, let alone his own. All his life he had tried to avoid military expeditions, the games, public executions, funerals&#x2014;anything that might remind him of mortality. If pain frightened him, death terrified him&#x2014;which, although I would never have been impertinent enough to point it out, was the principal reason we had fled Rome in the first place.<br><br>When finally we came within sight of the fortified walls of Brundisium, he decided not to venture inside. The port was so large and busy, so full of strangers, and so likely to be his desti�n�ation, he was convinced it was the obvious spot for his assassination. Instead we sought sanctuary a little way up the coast, in the residence of his old friend Marcus Laenius Flaccus. That night we slept in decent beds for the first time in three weeks, and the next morning we went down to the beach. The waves were much rougher than on the Sicilian side. A strong wind was hurling the Adriatic relentlessly against the rocks and shingle. Cicero loathed sea voyages at the best of times; this one promised to be especially treacherous. Yet it was our only means of escape. One hundred and twenty miles beyond the horizon lay the shore of Illyricum.<br><br>Flaccus, noticing his expression, said, &#x201c;Fortify your spirits, Cicero&#x2014;perhaps the bill won&#x2019;t pass, or one of the other tribunes will veto it. There must be someone left in Rome willing to stand up for you&#x2014;Pompey, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cicero, his gaze still fixed out to sea, made no reply, and a few days later we heard that the bill had indeed become law and that Flaccus was therefore guilty of a capital offence simply by having a convicted exile on his premises. Even so he tried to persuade us to stay. He insisted that Clodius didn&#x2019;t frighten him. But Cicero wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it: &#x201c;Your loyalty moves me, old friend, but that monster will have dispatched a team of his hired fighters to hunt me down the moment his law passed. There is no time to lose.&#x201d;<br><br>I had found a merchant ship in the harbour at Brundisium whose hard-pressed master was willing to risk a winter voyage across the Adriatic in return for a huge fee, and the next morning at first light, when no one was around, we went on board. She was a sturdy, broad-beamed vessel, with a crew of about twenty, used to ply the trade route between Italy and Dyrrachium. I was no judge of these things, but she looked safe enough to me. The master estimated the crossing would require a day and a half&#x2014;but we needed to leave quickly, he said, and take advantage of the favourable wind. So while the sailors made her ready and Flaccus waited on the quayside, Cicero quickly dictated a final message to his wife and children: It has been a fine life, a great career&#x2014;the good in me, nothing bad, has brought me down. My dear Terentia, loyalest and best of wives, my darling daughter Tullia, and little Marcus, our one remaining hope&#x2014;goodbye! I copied it out and passed it up to Flaccus. He raised his hand in farewell. Then the sail was unfurled, the cables cast off, the oarsmen pushed us away from the harbour wall, and we set off into the pale grey light.<br><br>at first we made good speed. cicero stood high above the deck on the steersmen&#x2019;s platform, leaning on the stern rail, watching the great lighthouse of Brundisium recede behind us. Apart from his visits to Sicily, it was the first time he had left Italy since his youth, when he went to Rhodes to learn oratory from Molon. Of all the men I ever knew, Cicero was the least equipped by temperament for exile. To thrive he needed the appurtenances of civilised society&#x2014;friends, news...</p><h2>Hawksmoor</h2><p>Peter Ackroyd&#39;s Hawksmoor - part of the limited edition PENGUIN STREET ART series: timeless writing, enduring design. &#39;There is no Light without Darknesse and no Substance without Shaddowe&#39; So proclaims Nicholas Dyer, assistant to Sir Christopher Wren and man with a commission to build seven London churches to stand as beacons of the enlightenment.

Debunking the conventional wisdom, which continues to assert that Muslim animosity toward Jews is entirely a 20th-century phenomenon fueled mainly by the protracted Arab-Israeli conflict, leading scholars provide example after example of antisemitic motifs in Muslim documents reaching back to the beginnings of Islam. The contributors show that the Koran itself is a significant source of hostility toward Jews, as well as other foundational Muslim texts including the hadith (the words and deeds of Muhammad as recorded by pious Muslim transmitters) and the sira (the earliest Muslim biographies of Muhammad). Many other examples are adduced in the writings of influential Muslim jurists, theologians, and scholars, from the Middle Ages through the contemporary era. These primary sources, and seminal secondary analyses translated here for the first time into English - such as Hartwig Hirschfeld&#39;s mid-1880s essays on Muhammad&#39;s subjugation of the Jews of Medina and George Vajda&#39;s elegant, comprehensive 1937 study of the hadith - detail the sacralized rationale for Islam&#39;s anti-Jewish bigotry. Numerous complementary historical accounts illustrate the resulting plight of Jewish communities in the Muslim world across space and time, culminating in the genocidal threat posed to the Jews of Israel today.</p><p>Andrew G.

Original.</p><p>Tricia McCary Rhodes is an author and teacher whose ministry flows from a deep desire to see Christ exalted. Her husband is pastor of New Hope Church, where the two of them have ministered for over 20 years. She lives in San Diego, California.These 31 "meditations on the exalted Christ" resonate with passion and conviction. Rhodes (The Soul at Rest) reflects on many different attributes of Christ, who is simultaneously a servant and a powerful Lord, the King of Kings and a humble companion. Rhodes casts her net widely for helpful illustrations, drawing upon some stories from the early Christian church (which is rare and refreshing for an evangelical book) while also exploring the significance of contemporary events like the Rwandan genocide of 1994. The book offers strong Bible study resources, as when Rhodes teases out important meanings from the oft-overlooked story of the New Testament prophetess Anna in the Gospel of Luke. While the writing can be overdone (e.g., excessive adjectival descriptions and italicized words), Rhodes's book speaks ardently about the love and power of the risen Christ. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mirages of Marriage</h2><p>Examines the factors that contribute to a successful marital relationship and the reasons underlying the failure of numerous marriages</p><p>The late Don D.

Her books have been translated into 21 languages and made into a television series. She was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, where she now lives with her husband.Her heart was pounding and her stomach contracted with fear. Amelie was on the edge of her seat during the last ten minutes of the lesson. As soon as the bell rang, she leaped to her feet and raced out into the corridor, with Tuva right behind her. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come with you to the bus stop!&#x201d; Tuva shouted. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The girls pulled on their jackets as they ran toward the door, pausing briefly on the stairs to zip them up and put on their hats. It was already dark outside, and the bitter wind blowing in off the sea was icy cold. On top of everything else, it was pouring. Only two weeks to go until Christmas Eve, and not a flake of snow in sight. Horrible! Amelie thought. She would have liked to turn around and rejoin her classmates, but she had to dash home to pick up her Lucia robe and her candle. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The music teacher had said that everyone had to get changed so that it would feel real when they practiced for the last time before the Christmas concert and the Lucia procession. Dress rehearsal, that&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;d called it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Things had been chaotic that morning. As usual her brother, Julien, hadn&#x2019;t wanted to go to preschool; he was always tired and grumpy when he woke up. Their mom had spent ages coaxing him into his clothes, and they had all been seriously stressed&#x2014;and very late&#x2014;by the time they left the house. In the rush Amelie had forgotten her Lucia bag, which was still sitting on the floor in the hallway. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She had her own bus pass because she didn&#x2019;t want to go to after-school club anymore. There was only one stop between the school and �nnar�d, where she lived, but it was dangerous to walk along the narrow road in the dark. Even though she had reflectors on both her boots and her coat sleeves, Mom insisted that she catch the bus. Tuva lived near school, so she didn&#x2019;t need a pass. The girls were best friends. Amelie would be ten in two months and three days, and she thought after-school club was for little kids. Tuva agreed, even though her birthday wasn&#x2019;t until May 5. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls could hear the bus pulling up at the stop. Or was it leaving?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; they yelled. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They ran down the hill as fast as they could, only to see the red taillights disappearing into the distance. The next bus wasn&#x2019;t due for twenty minutes. No! She had to be back for the rehearsal in half an hour!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The girls stood at the deserted bus shelter for a couple of minutes, trying to catch their breath. Maybe Amelie should just run home&#x2014;it would only take ten minutes. But then I&#x2019;ll stink, she thought. The familiar sound of a chugging engine cut through her thoughts. Kristoffer! He and Tuva were related, although Amelie wasn&#x2019;t quite sure how. He&#x2019;d given them a ride on his EPA-tractor several times. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tuva positioned herself by the side of the road, frantically waving her arms as the slow, short truck approached. Amelie&#x2019;s heart started pounding as Kristoffer stopped. He wound down the window and gave them an inquiring look. Loud rockabilly music poured from the speakers, echoing around the bus shelter. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hi&#x2014;can you give Amelie a ride? She missed the bus . . . Pleeease, Kristoffer!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded and Amelie ran around to the other side of the vehicle. She gave Tuva a cheerful wave before opening the door and jumping in. She sank down on the soft seat with a sigh of relief. White leather&#x2014;cool. Kristoffer&#x2019;s EPA-tractor, no, A-tractor, was really nice. He was very particular about the names of cars, and apparently EPA-tractor was an old-fashioned term. There was a lovely smell from the fir-tree-shaped air freshener that dangled from the rearview mirror. Or maybe the smell was the gel Kristoffer used to keep his long hair in place? His &#x201c;Elvis quiff,&#x201d; that&#x2019;s what Tuva called it. She thought it looked good, but Amelie wasn&#x2019;t impressed. She liked One Direction, and none of the boys in the band had that kind of hairstyle. Kristoffer&#x2019;s hoodie was covered in dirt and oil stains, as were his jeans. Amelie knew that he and his dad fixed up old cars.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She gave Tuva another wave as they set off. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a rehearsal and we have to wear our Lucia costumes, but we don&#x2019;t need any sparkle, not until tomorrow. It&#x2019;s the Christmas concert. All the parents come to watch. Me and Tuva are part of the procession. We sing all the time, and the little ones get to be sheep and shepherds, and we&#x2019;re like angels and . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amelie chattered away. She knew Kristoffer, after all, though she had never been alone with him since Tuva had always been there when he had given them a ride in the past. But he seemed the same as always, and maybe she kept on talking because she knew he wouldn&#x2019;t answer. He didn&#x2019;t say much. Hardly anything, in fact. He was nice, though. He was taking her home. She leaned back in her seat, secure in the knowledge that she&#x2019;d be back at school in time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Julien was every bit as difficult in the afternoon when Maria arrived to pick him up from preschool. He flatly refused to go home. He and Malte were in the middle of building something with Legos, and there was no way it could wait until the following day. Maria felt the sweat trickling down her back as she tried to cajole and persuade him. Eventually she grabbed him and forced him into his outdoor clothes. He was cross and overtired. People talked about the terrible twos, but he was five years old now and had been behaving that way ever since he was born, Maria thought irritably. She exchanged a weary glance with the teacher, who had joined them in the entrance hall. Together they managed to get Julien into his jacket and boots, but they gave up on his thick waterproof over-trousers. Needless to say, he tripped and fell in a great big puddle on the way to the car. His jeans were soaked through, and he started whining again. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just going to collect Amelie, then we&#x2019;ll go straight home. You can have hot chocolate with whipped cream, and I&#x2019;ll take some cinnamon buns out of the freezer. I think we&#x2019;ve earned a treat after a day like this, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She kissed his forehead and lifted him into the car. She had a struggle with the child seat, of course&#x2014;it was definitely one of those days! Only when she sank down in the driver&#x2019;s seat did she let out a long breath. Thank goodness they were only a few minutes away from Amelie&#x2019;s school. She could use a hot chocolate and a cinnamon bun herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maria looked from Tuva to Therese Jansson, the girls&#x2019; music teacher, in confusion. There were only the three of them in the hall where the concert was due to take place the next day. A strong smell of resin was coming from the tall Christmas tree in the corner, its branches weighed down with all the decorations the children had added. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t come back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No. I called her like a thousand times, but there&#x2019;s no answer,&#x201d; Tuva said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I tried calling her, too, both on her cell and your home number, but I had my hands full with the rehearsal . . .&#x201d; Therese Jansson made an apologetic gesture and swallowed hard. Maria noticed that her hand was shaking as she pushed her large horn-rimmed glasses up her nose. She&#x2019;s worried, too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Amelie wouldn&#x2019;t just not turn up,&#x201d; Maria said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Absolutely not, and she was really looking forward to singing her solo,&#x201d; the teacher agreed. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She always answers her cell,&#x201d; Tuva said firmly. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She&#x2019;s right, Amelie always picks up, Maria thought, her anxiety growing. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drive you home, Tuva,&#x201d; she said quickly. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can you let me know when you find her? It doesn&#x2019;t matter how late it is,&#x201d; Therese Jansson said nervously. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Maria was already on her way to the car.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>They&#x2019;d searched the house and garden. Julien had been happy to race around hunting for his sister. Hide-and-seek was his favorite game, so he knew all the best places. But he couldn&#x2019;t find Amelie anywhere. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the counter there was a glass with a drop of milk in the bottom, and a banana skin was in the sink. Before Amelie left, she had gone to the bathroom to pee, and she&#x2019;d forgotten to flush, presumably because she was in a hurry. There was no sign of the plastic bag containing her Lucia costume and the little battery-powered candle, so Maria knew that her daughter had been home, eaten something, gone to the toilet, grabbed the bag, and dashed off into the rain and darkness. But she hadn&#x2019;t made it back to school . . . <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanically Maria made hot chocolate and defrosted the promised cinnamon bun in the microwave for Julien. As he settled down contentedly with his snack, she called everyone she could think of. No one had seen or heard from Amelie. She tried her daughter&#x2019;s cell phone at regular intervals; the signal rang out, but there was no reply. Tuva was right&#x2014;Amelie always answered her cell. Only recently she&#x2019;d been given a new model, and she was so proud of it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear constricted Maria&#x2019;s throat. Eventually she managed to pull herself together enough to contact her mother-in-law. Her hands shook as she keyed in the number. When she heard Iris Holm&#x2019;s calm voice, Maria&#x2019;s self-control gave way and she started to cry. She was relieved that Iris was home; she&#x2019;d always been a reliable support. Between sobs Maria explained that Amelie was missing. She asked Iris if she could come over and look after Julien while she went out to search the area.</p><h2>Decoying the Yanks: Jackson&#39;s Valley Campaign (Civil War)</h2><p>Recounts the life and career of General Stonewall Jackson</p><p></p><h2>A Time to Heal: The Road to Recovery for Adult Children of Alcoholics</h2><p>Describes the devastating effects prolonged exposure to alcoholism can have on a developing child and the steps that must be taken to reverse these effects</p><p>This is the latest of several self-help books dealing with the problems of adult children of alcoholics (ACAs).

Taken together, their pursuits present a natural experiment into the limits and the nature of memory and language. <br> <br> Part scientific detective story, part travelogue, part valentine to anyone who&#x2019;s ever hoped to <i>sprechen</i> or <i>parler</i> something other than a mother tongue, <i>Babel No More</i> takes us all over the world to look at language learning in an entirely new way.</p><p><b>Michael Erard</b> has graduate degrees in linguistics and rhetoric from the University of Texas at Austin.

Behind the counter were the cooks who had produced the fragrant bowl of noodles I was now eating.<br> <br>The boss, an older Japanese man, read from waiters&#x2019; slips and shouted orders to his crew in Japanese. Two heavy-set, young Hispanic men, with tattooed arms and baseball hats worn backward, moved from pot to pot through the steam-filled space, ladling this, mixing that, all so smoothly I couldn&#x2019;t tell when they had finished one order and started another. In the quieter moments, they filled containers with chopped herbs and wiped down counters, talking to one another in Spanish and addressing a third cook, another Japanese man, in the pidgin English of the restaurant kitchen.<br> <br>Three languages, two of which weren&#x2019;t native to the people speaking them, and the rhythm of their immaculate noodle ballet never stuck or slowed.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s amazing that the world runs so well, given that people use languages that they didn&#x2019;t grow up using, haven&#x2019;t studied in schools, and in which they&#x2019;ve never been tested or certified. Yet it does. The noodle scene was probably reflected that same day hundreds of millions of times all over the world, in markets, restaurants, taxis, airports, shops, docks, classrooms, and streets, where men, women, and children of all skin colors and nationalities met with, ate with, bought and sold with, flirted with, boarded with, worked next to, served, introduced, greeted, cursed at, and asked directions from others who didn&#x2019;t speak their language. They did all this successfully, even though they might have spoken with accents, used simple words, made mistakes, paraphrased, and done other things that marked them as linguistic outsiders. Such encounters between non-native speakers have always textured human experience. In our era, these encounters are peaking, as the ties between language and geography have been weakened by migration, global business, cheap travel, cell phones, satellite TV, and the Internet.<br> <br>You may be familiar with the stories of languages, such as English or French or Latin, that are (or were) valuable cultural capital. This book tells another story, about a kind of cognitive capital, the stuff you bring to learning a new language.<br> <br>We once lived in bubbles, disconnected from the hubbub of the world. But more of these bubbles, where one or only a few languages used to be spoken, are connected each day, and more and more of us are passing between them. It is clear that multilingual niches are proliferating, and that monolinguals (such as myself) need to live and act multilingually. But that&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m writing about.<br> <br>Something else is happening as well: we&#x2019;ve begun to want to naturally move among these bubbles unimpeded. Maybe you&#x2019;re a Dagestani woman living in Sharjah, one of the United Arab Emirates, who speaks Russian to your husband while he speaks Arabic to you. Maybe you&#x2019;re an American project manager leading phone meetings, in English, with engineers from China, India, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Maybe you&#x2019;re a Japanese speaker working next to two Hondurans in a noodle shop. Maybe you&#x2019;re a Beijinger finally realizing your dream to see the Grand Canyon. Ideas, information, goods, and people are flowing more easily through space, and this is creating a sensibility about language learning that&#x2019;s rooted more in the trajectories of an individual&#x2019;s life than in one&#x2019;s citizenship or nationality. It&#x2019;s embedded in economic demands, not the standards of schools and governments. That means that our brains also have to flow, to remain plastic and open to new skills and information. One of these skills is learning new ways to communicate.<br> <br>If you could alleviate people&#x2019;s anxieties about language learning, you&#x2019;d solve what has shaped up to be the core linguistic challenge of the twenty-first century: How can I learn a language quickly? How well do I have to speak or write it for it to be useful? Whose standards will I have to meet? Will I ever be taken as native? And are my economic status, my identity, and my brain going to be changed?<br> <br>How adults learn languages is central to the emergence of English as a global lingua franca. In fact, the spread of English is the signal example of the reconsideration of &#x201c;native-like&#x201d; abilities in a language. In the coming decades, as many as two billion people will learn English as a second language. Some large fraction of them will be adults who are attracted by the prestige and utility that has made it the most popular language to learn over the past five decades.15 In China, the size of the English market has been valued at $3.5 billion, with as many as thirty thousand companies offering English classes.16 It&#x2019;s said that on a daily basis, as many as 70 percent of all interactions in English around the world occur between non-native speakers. This means that native English speakers have less control over determining the &#x201c;proper&#x201d; pronunciation and grammar of English. Some experts in China and Europe now advocate teaching standardized foreign Englishes that wouldn&#x2019;t fly in the language&#x2019;s home countries.<br> <br>English may be the only global language with more non-native speakers than native ones. However, it isn&#x2019;t the only additional language that people are learning in the $83 billion worldwide language-learning market&#x2014;a figure that doesn&#x2019;t include spending on schools, teachers, and textbooks in educational systems.17 In the United States, 70 percent of college students in foreign-language classes study Spanish, French, and German, though Arabic, Chinese, and Korean are increasing in popularity.18 If you live in Brazil, you&#x2019;ll learn Spanish, now compulsory in schools. If you live in East Asia, it&#x2019;s Mandarin Chinese. In Europe, thanks to the European Union, it&#x2019;s French and German. Hindi in India. Swahili in East Africa. Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea. But speaking like a native, at a moment when people need extra languages to make a living, is a standard to which adult speakers literally cannot afford to be held.<br> <br>Also, pumping new life into endangered or extinct languages depends on teaching them to people who have lost the moldable brains of youth. And when ancestral tongues die out, their communities don&#x2019;t become mute&#x2014;children and adults learn to speak something else, often a language connected to the demise of their ancestral one. I say this not to glibly dismiss the issue but to point out the full scope of the problem. Also, exciting new technologies for translating speech and text between languages don&#x2019;t eliminate the need for people to learn languages. But they might enable multilingual transactions&#x2014;for instance, by using free machine translation tools, I can get a rough gist of a web page in a language I don&#x2019;t know.<br> <br>The fragmentary, improvised, simultaneous use of several languages all at once that I witnessed in the noodle kitchen doesn&#x2019;t occur only in New York City, London (named in 1999 as the most multilingual city in the world), Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, and other major world cities.19 No longer are borders, universities, and transportation hubs the only linguistic crossroads: this morning, my Twitter feed featured updates in French, Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, Italian, and English. That same feed reported fraudulent email scams, called 419s, that have begun to circulate in Welsh, German, and Swedish.<br> <br>Anyplace on the globe, you can surf through television channels in many languages; on the news channels, you&#x2019;ll see political protesters half a world away carrying signs written in English. Pop stars learn other languages in which to sing songs, to win ears in more markets. And it&#x2019;s not just in the flow of digital information that we&#x2019;re encountering more languages. Signs on the streets in your city are appearing in more languages than they used to, and on any given day, your local hotel might be home to a trade delegation from Kazakhstan, Brazil, or Bulgaria.<br> <br>With so many languages to learn and so many reasons to learn them, it&#x2019;s easy to miss the sheer humanity of the undertaking, which is evident in the biological equipment&#x2014;brains, eyes, tongues, and hands&#x2014;that every adult brings to the task. And if you&#x2019;ve ever tried to learn a language, you already know that adult brains have limits (though not absolute ones) that constrain their efforts. As a result, people will speak their new languages with a lot of variety. They won&#x2019;t sound like native speakers. And yet they may need to speak new languages and dialects in order to survive in this economy. What should they do?<br> <br><br> <br>Imagine a person who can learn languages very easily&#x2014;someone who can navigate the multilingual hullabaloo by leaping language barriers with a single bound. Someone for whom learning a language is easier than relying on a translation. A role model, in other words, for these globalized times&#x2014;someone who, like Mezzofanti, learns without effort, remembers huge amounts, and has amazing powers of recognition and recombination. Not a parrot. Not a computer. A human superlearner.<br> <br>One of Mezzofanti&#x2019;s gifts was an ability to learn a new language in a remarkably short time, using neither dictionaries nor grammars. Even without a shared language to help him translate, Mezzofanti would ask a speaker to repeat the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer until he grasped the language&#x2019;s sounds and rhythms.20 Then he would break it into the parts of speech: nouns, adjectives, verbs. Honed by thousands of hours of practice, his ability to extract a picture of the language from a small slice of it was unusually keen. He combined this sense of structure with a perfect recall for vocabulary, which he could combine into new sentences.<br> <br>Because aspects of both memory and pronunciation can be sharpened through training, perhaps these weren&#x2019;t gifts of birth. Yet he possessed other, inborn, gifts. He admitted that God had given him &#x201c;an incredible flexibility of the organs of speech.&#x201d;21 Visited by fluent speakers who were amazed by his accent, his knowledge of literature, his humor, and his love of wordplay, Mezzofanti was a social chameleon. Even in languages in which he sounded like a learner, he engaged quickly and authentically. If a dozen people spoke to him, in a dozen different languages, each one left the encounter feeling that the cardinal had spoken his or her language the most fluently. What modern science can&#x2019;t explain is how he could switch from one language to another without confusing them. Numerous accounts exist of his carrying on simultaneous conversations in more languages than he had fingers. One writer compared it to &#x201c;a bird flitting from spray to spray.&#x201d;22<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s suppose that Mezzofanti was a myth. Could someone actually do what he was supposed to have done? Could someone represent all the peoples and places of the world in one body&#x2014;in whose body they coexist without confusion or conflict&#x2014;because they have more languages than allegiances, either political or cultural?<br> <br>In the biblical story of Babel, the people of Babel set out to build a tower to confront God in heaven. Sharing one language allowed them to communicate perfectly and move along with the construction of their tower. But God put a stop to their tower&#x2014;and its arrogance&#x2014;by scrambling their shared language. In the ensuing miscommunication, the humans began to disagree, the building halted, the people scattered, and the tower crumbled. In the Sumerian version of the same story, a god named Enki, jealous about humans&#x2019; fondness for another god, Enlil, cursed humans with many languages.<br> <br>A language superlearner could embrace this curse of disparate languages and whisper in its ear, &#x201c;Babel, no more.&#x201d;<br> <br>Every adult of normal intelligence on the planet, about six billion people, has learned at least one language as a child. A sizable (though uncounted and, interestingly, uncountable) number also speak an extra tongue. In some places, many individuals speak four or five languages they learned, even as adults. But that&#x2019;s not the sort of person I have in mind.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m talking about those rumored language superlearners, glimpsed here and there, widely separated in time and space. Some, like Mithridates, lived half in legend; some, like Giuseppe Mezzofanti, lived in a bygone age. Some supposedly live among us right now. They are &#x201c;hyperpolyglots.&#x201d; Some can speak or read to varying degrees in many dozens of languages. According to one definition, a hyperpolyglot is someone who speaks (or can use in reading, writing, or translating) at least six languages; this is the definition around which I built my early investigations. Later I found that eleven languages may be a more accurate cutoff.<br> <br>I was originally drawn to hyperpolyglots for the way they reflect and refract ideas about language, literacy, and aspirations about language learning and cultural capital in the modern world: who has it, who wants it, who gets it. It&#x2019;s easy to find someone with a ready anecdote about an uncle, a high school professor, or someone met on an airplane who speaks a lot of languages or who can learn them very easily. &#x201c;Picks them up,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s said, as if languages had handles or could fit into vacuum cleaner hoses. Because we know how hard it is to learn even one foreign language, we receive the tales with awe. Then we repeat them with a skepticism or wonder that we save for stories about saints, healers, and prodigious lovers.<br> <br>At the outset, all I had were such stories, the tantalizing tales told over the centuries about people with remarkable linguistic gifts. Most of the stories are legends, unreliable as wholes. Yet hidden in them are kernels of truth that are subject to discovery, assessment, and testing, which in turn can guide further exploration. Do such language superlearners really exist? How many are out there, and what are they like? What could this gift for learning languages amount to, if it&#x2019;s real? And what are the upper limits of our ability to learn, remember, and speak languages?<br> <br>Babel No More is an account of my search for solid answers to these and other questions. I decided to write as a curious adventurer rather than as a scholar, seeking the freedom to move across intellectual borders. Because this journey had no predestined end, I couldn&#x2019;t write as if I knew what I&#x2019;d find. I drew on published research literature, my interviews with scientists, my investigation in historical archives, memoirs by&#x2014;and, of course, my interviews with&#x2014;hyperpolyglots. An invaluable amount of information was gathered via an online survey of people who say they know six languages or more. All this was necessary to see why these souls have escaped the curse of the gods&#x2014;and what the gods might have demanded of them in return. Would the secret of speaking many languages provide a key to the secret of speaking any language at all?<br> <br>During my explorations, I grappled with the question of how best to make sense of what hyperpolyglots do in their lives with their languages. Whose standards would I use to judge their abilities, if indeed those need to be judged? I also had to confront why language scientists have refused to consider hyperpolyglots, talented language learners, and language accumulators as anything more than curiosities or freaks. For instance, Carol Myers-Scotton, a linguist who is an expert on bilingualism, recommended in one of her books, &#x201c;When you meet people who tell you they speak four or five languages, give them a smile to show you&#x2019;re impressed, but don&#x2019;t take this claim very seriously.&#x201d;23 I&#x2019;m not exaggerating when I say that no one has critically looked at pe...</p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub, Volume 16: The Gateway into Winter</h2><p>The Lone Wolf's arch-enemy, Yagyu Retsudo, begins to reach the end of his rope, as he sends his only daughter and last child after the blood-storm that is Itto Ogami!

At the crossroads of the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian peninsula, the area dominated by what the Romans called Syria was at times a scene of violent confrontation, but more often one of peaceful interaction, of prosperous cultivation, energetic production, and commerce--a crucible of cultural, religious, and artistic innovations that profoundly determined the course of world history. </p><p> Maurice Sartre has written a long overdue and comprehensive history of the Semitic Near East (modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel) from the eve of the Roman conquest to the end of the third century C.E. and the dramatic rise of Christianity. Sartre's broad yet finely detailed perspective takes in all aspects of this history, not just the political and military, but economic, social, cultural, and religious developments as well. He devotes particular attention to the history of the Jewish people, placing it within that of the whole Middle East. </p><p> Drawing upon the full range of ancient sources, including literary texts, Greek, Latin, and Semitic inscriptions, and the most recent archaeological discoveries, <i>The Middle East under Rome</i> will be an indispensable resource for students and scholars. This absorbing account of intense cultural interaction will also engage anyone interested in the history of the Middle East. </p></p><p><b>Maurice Sartre</b> is Professor of History, University of Tours and the Institut Universitaire de France.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/SARMID_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Wings of Fire Boxed Set, Books 1-8 The First Eight</h2><p>This Box Set Contains the First Eight Books in the Wings of Fire Series: The Dragonet Prophecy, The Lost Heir, The Hidden Kingdom, The Dark Secret, The Brightest Night, Moon Rising, Winter Turning, Escaping Peril.

Unseen for 50 years, this submarine battlefield received its first visitor in 1992, aquanaut Robert Ballard. The twisted, encrusted shapes he saw are here spread out with the same lavish pictorial formula used in his enormously popular albums on the <i>Titanic</i> and the <i>Bismarck</i>. Prewar photos of battleships in dress regalia contrast graphically with eerie paintings and photos of shell and torpedo strikes that destroyed them and their crews. Now--as in the moment of foundering during the half dozen sharp, short naval battles around the island--guns aim askew, fatal holes gape wide, and turret plates peel back. The <i>Titanic</i> and the <i>Bismarck</i>--both on maiden voyages--sailed to the deep with ill-fated majesty. But Ballard treats these unheralded ships--American, Australian, and Japanese--with the same technical accuracy and awesome reverence. The author's name alone should trigger demand.

Our body's built-in reward system, driven by the chemical dopamine, tells us to do things that give us pleasure: Creative energy, falling in love, entrepreneurship&#x2015;even the continued procreation of the human race&#x2015;are driven by this system. Unfortunately, so is the urge to overeat.</p><p>In <i>The Hunger Fix</i>, Dr. Pam Peeke uses the latest neuroscience to explain how, with repeated exposure coupled with life stresses, any food can become a "False Fix" and ensnare you in a vicious cycle of food obsession, overeating, and addiction. Indeed, she shows that dopamine rushes in the body can work <i>exactly </i>the same way with food as with drugs like cocaine.</p><p>Luckily, this very same system can be easily rewired to reward us with a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. <i>The Hunger Fix </i>lays out a science-based three-stage plan that shows us how to break our addiction to False Fixes and replace them with healthier rewards. Fun fitness activities, customized meal plans, and delicious, satisfying recipes are designed to trigger the specific neurochemical cascade that stimulates your body's reward system, reclaims your hijacked brain, and supports your lifelong recovery. Energizing Healthy Fixes such as meditating, having sex, writing your own blog, or going for a walk on the beach&#x2015;even laughing&#x2015;quickly replace the junk food, couch time, and other self-destructive habits that can leave you unhappy and overweight.</p><p>Packed with practical tips, useful advice, and plenty of wit, wisdom, and inspiring stories of those who have successfully transformed their bodies, <i>The Hunger Fix </i>is a lifechanging program for anyone (of any size) trapped by food obsessions and the urge to overeat.</p></p><p>Pam Peeke MD, MPH, FACP is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Body for Life for Women</i>, <i>Fight Fat after Forty</i>, and <i>Fit to Live</i>.

A best friend. A helper, a life raft.<br><br>An entrenched habit that's so comfortable, it feels like a hug or an island of calm.<br><br>A fix.<br><br>A fix starts simply enough. You think about doing something that you like to do--drink a mojito, or check your iPhone, or get it on with your boyfriend or girlfriend--and that thought lights up an entire dopamine- driven reward pathway in your brain.<br><br>You feel a rush of pleasure. You start thinking about when and how you are going to do that thing:<br><br>Is it happy hour yet?<br><br>Can I sneak a peek at my e-mail during this meeting?<br><br>Will he or she be around tonight? When are we going to connect?<br><br>Your brain becomes consumed by the drive to satisfy that urge. You try, but you just can't get it out of your head. You give in.<br><br>And then, as soon as you satisfy the raging hunger, bingo: You feel another rush. Your brain says, "Yeah! This is amazing. Bring it on. I want more."<br><br>You need your fix.<br><br>Most of the time, this neurological process is a good thing. Nature wants humans to stick around, so she uses this system to reward us for doing things that will ensure our survival--eating food, bonding with loved ones, having sex, making babies. Preferably as often as possible.<br><br>As a result, everything we do--from the time we wake up until we collapse into bed--is driven by reward. We're either getting reward in the short term (enjoying an hourlong massage) or in the long term (earning a college degree after studying for 4 years).<br><br>The reward can also be to avoid pain. I learned that as a little girl who didn't like to brush her teeth. After suffering through a cavity, I soon learned that my real reward was never seeing that dentist again.<br><br>This same reward system drives us to learn, to create, to innovate, to pursue our goals. But as a medical doctor specializing in metabolism and weight management, logging thousands of hours a year to educate the public about behavioral change, I've seen firsthand how the dopamine rush cuts both ways. The tremendous high you get from a run in the park or a hike to the top of a mountain can be powerful enough to change your life. But that healthy high occupies the same pathways, and can easily become confused with, the dopamine hit from a snort of cocaine or a puff of a cigarette. Clearly, not all rewards are created equal--and some can kill you.<br><br>In the past few years, I've started to see a growing manifestation of this double-edged sword in my own medical practice. More and more men and women are coming into my office desperate to find an answer to the same questions: Why can't I stop thinking about food? How can a cookie or plate of pasta or bag of chocolates have this kind of hold on me? I feel like a junkie!<br><br>As I listen to people's tortured stories of unbearable cravings, yo-yo dieting, weight obsession, and emotion-driven stress eating, I've seen a pattern emerge. Their pleas for help are no longer your standard "Gosh, I'd love to drop 10 �ds before the reunion" fare. Instead, these entreaties have become eerily similar to the cries for help from my patients with hard- core drug or alcohol addictions:<br><br>"I just need that sugar fix every afternoon. If I don't get it, I'll go crazy with withdrawal."<br><br>"I need a dose of pizza."<br><br>"Those Tostitos and dip are like crack to me--once I start, I just can't stop."<br><br>I started to realize that in more and more of my patients, these cravings are the result of a reward system gone awry. I had also reviewed the new science that shows the mere anticipation of that food-related dopamine high will cause the reward centers of the brain to light up like Times Square on New Year's Eve--the same as brain scans of cocaine addicts eager for their next fix. It doesn't take much to trigger this cascade of brain chemicals: A casually mentioned word, a picture in a magazine or on TV, or a smell from a bakery is all it takes to awaken the desperate cravings. That same insatiable drive for reward keeps all addicts pressing the dopamine accelerator, overriding their brain's normal "satisfaction" signals.<br><br>These dopamine-driven moments of pleasure start to accumulate. With constant practice, they progress to habits, carving deep neural pathways in the brain. With every repetition of the cycle, those pathways get stronger and healthier alternatives get pruned out to make way for these new, ultra- rewarding but unhealthy habits. A walk in the neighborhood with your best friend begins to pale in comparison with sitting in front of the TV and bingeing on bags of your favorite chips. This False Fix becomes the default, setting up a domino effect, constantly reinforcing itself.<br><br>I Need a Fix<br><br>Voices of Addiction1<br><br>On my blog on WebMD, I asked people to share their thoughts on food addiction--is it real? The answers were very telling. See if you can recognize yourself in any of these comments.<br><br>My addiction to ice cream and other sweets began in childhood. Celebrations were made with half pints of the hand-packed ice cream of our choice, which became an addiction to relieve grief, stress, and other emotions. Because after all--life is good with ice cream.<br><br>While I have been eating mostly healthy for 9 years, I still cannot have ice-cream-type things in my home--still a binge-type food. Why having it available sets me off, I have no idea.--Jis4Judy<br><br>For those whose recommendations include, "Well, just don't eat that," I wish it were that simple. It's like a smoker's need for cigs and an alcoholic's need for alcohol. If I have a lot of sweets available, I have a hard time not eating all of them. I keep it out of the house, except on special occasions.--nursingbug<br><br>I still struggle with the bread issue but am constantly re-focusing to look at what I really want: consistency, a comfortable weight, and peace of mind. When I eat binge foods, I switch into an addict, focused on the next fix. I hate that cycle, but not always enough to avoid it.--init4life<br><br>Of all the stresses I have subjected myself to in my life, I thought smoking was the worst. I never even thought I had an addiction to food!<br><br>When it was clear to me that I was as dependent on food as I was on smoking to get me through events, that's when I realized I was fighting one of the toughest enemies of all ... me.--mawsings<br><br>My mother was an alcoholic. She did not eat much; she always felt she was competing for my father's attention, that she had to be thin. So she smoked and drank vodka. She hid the smoking from my father, and she would sneak her vodka on some occasions.<br><br>I was hiding foods because I was embarrassed by the size that I had become. Someone asked me why I just didn't stop eating the foods that I was gorging on. I could not do it at that time. I was not ready to change, and I had not hit my rock bottom.--GoingForGoal<br><br>See if this sounds familiar: Eat in bed, stay up too late, get rotten sleep. Feel like hell in the morning, reach for sugary, caffeinated foods to stay awake. Mindlessly seek the numbing of "just one more [candy/ chip/cookie]." A glass of wine at dinner becomes three, and maybe even take a sleeping pill before bed to get "a good night's rest."<br><br>Without fully realizing it, many people have created a life of continuous, comfortable opportunities to "dope up" in front of the computer, in the doorway of the fridge, and on the couch. They are driven to repeatedly score hits of what I call "False Fixes"--anything (like food) that leads to short-term reward in association with self-destructive behavior, followed by feelings of guilt, shame, and defeat. In contrast, Healthy Fixes are productive, positive habits associated with feelings of pride, happiness, and achievement: the enjoyment of tasty, delicious whole foods, gardening on a sunny day, or taking a long walk with your best friend. When False Fixes prevail, Healthy Fixes are tossed aside. The seductive lies of the False Fixes now occupy center stage. In pursuit of each False Fix, you create self-defeating habits to support your habit. You start to set up rituals surrounding your bingeing. And voila, you're ensnared in your own endless vicious False Fix-seeking cycle.<br><br>This phenomenon clearly isn't just in my practice. We can see ample evidence of what many False Fixes have created in society:<br><br>Right this second, 800,000 people are texting or chatting on cell phones while driving.<br><br>The average child spends 53 hours a week in front of some kind of screen.<br><br>The average American family carries almost $15,000 in credit card debt.<br><br>And now we see the emergence of food addiction, which is striking us at all ages: Toddlers' obesity rates have doubled in the past 30 years, and older kids' rates have tripled. Teens' rates almost quadrupled. Half the population of the United States will be prediabetic or diabetic by 2020--an estimate that, as a devoted public health advocate and policy advisor, frightens me to the core. We've even made up new words--such as diabesity-- to describe what we're becoming. Even men and women of average size who've never been seriously overweight can struggle with food obsessions and addictive behavior. Folks who have dropped weight and kept it off still continue to grapple with how to avoid their "crack." Food addiction does not discriminate--it can afflict people anywhere along their weight- management journey.<br><br>The Most Devious Fix of All<br><br>You can get high on dopamine in many different ways. Some fixes are productive, like going to the gym or reading the Sunday New York Times. These highs build you up--you come away from them feeling proud, fulfilled, and eager for more. These are Healthy Fixes.<br><br>A False Fix, by contrast, is destructive. You feel guilty, ashamed, and disappointed.<br><br>This is the last time. Never again. And I mean it.<br><br>But once the False Fix cycle is triggered, you feel like you don't have a choice.<br><br>Some False Fixes, like drugs, nicotine, and alcohol, are clearly addictive substances. And let's not forget sex and gambling. But food? Is it a federal offense to rip through an entire cheesecake? Will you be hauled off and convicted of a felony fat count?<br><br>For years, many of my colleagues refuted the fact that food can be "addictive." Yes, the research said that foods can be habit forming--but just on a behavioral level. There was no proven biological basis to believe otherwise. What people need is willpower! Hey, it's just a cookie, for crying out loud. Control yourself! Discipline!<br><br>Addiction researchers have long documented the danger of "real" drugs of abuse. Not only can you die from your meth addiction, this addictive substance directly changes the physical structure of your brain. As drugs hijack the pleasure system and wipe out dopamine receptors, the brain adapts and adjusts, creating a tolerance that demands ever more of its drug to get the same False Fix high. Eventually the addict has to have the substance to simply feel normal. He doesn't just want it; he needs it. He hungers for it.<br><br>At that point, all other healthy survival motivations--self-care, family, friends, career, sex, love--are cast aside in favor of scoring the drug. Researchers call this deadly change "motivational toxicity," which, in the case of hard drugs, can run its course pretty quickly: Basically, unless you get clean, you're looking at jail or even death.<br><br>Well, some experts would say, unlike heroin, meth, or crack, at least you can't die from OD'ing on Jamocha Almond Fudge--at least not immediately. So food wasn't considered a "real" addiction. It's never been taken seriously. Until now.<br><br>In the past couple of years, the entire medical field has started to shift. Researchers have uncovered irrefutable proof that food itself can, even under the strictest definitions, be considered a substance of abuse. Nora Volkow, MD, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), has committed millions of dollars to studying the relationship between food and addiction.<br><br>Dr. Volkow is my hero. She has made it her professional mission to study how certain foods can hijack the brain's reward system. Beginning her odyssey in 2001, Dr. Volkow and her team used PET scans and radioactive chemicals that bind to dopamine receptors.2 Their research revealed that obese people had far fewer dopamine receptors in the brain's striatum, the reward center, and therefore had to eat more to experience the same reward or high as average-weighted individuals.<br><br>In 2002, Dr. Volkow delved into the craving or "wanting" question. When people were exposed to their favorite treat foods but were not allowed to eat them, a tidal wave of dopamine surged through the striatum.3 They said they "hungered" for their fixes. Yet they weren't hungry at all. This is exactly what happens in the brain of drug abusers after just watching a video of people using cocaine.<br><br>Since these landmark findings, numerous NIDA-funded studies published in gold-standard peer-reviewed journals such as Nature Neuroscience have proved that the brain is forever changed by this food addiction cycle of anticipation and reward. When rats are given free access to the kinds of "highly palatable foods" that we humans are surrounded with all the time-- such as chocolate, cheesecake, bacon, sausage, and other fat and processed food treats--these foods change the structure of the brain the same way that cocaine does. Researchers from Yale University have used functional MRI (fMRI) studies to prove that both lean and obese women who test positive for addictive behavior around food show the exact same pattern of neural activity as a chronic drug abuser: very high levels of anticipation of their drug of choice--in this case, a chocolate milk shake--but very low levels of satisfaction after consuming them.4<br><br>The addiction develops like this: Think of a river during a flood. The water charges over the banks, taking down trees and houses along the way. Continued dopamine flooding in the brain works the same way. The pathway between the ventral tegmental and the nucleus accumbens areas of the brain floods with dopamine again and again. The brain think it has "too much" dopamine--so the brain attempts to compensate for this overabundance by battening down the hatches, decreasing the total number of dopamine receptors to lessen the amount of dopamine your brain absorbs. This "down regulation" decimates receptors in a variety of brain regions, particularly your limbic system, the site of motivation and emotions.</p><h2>Time Cat: The Remarkable Journeys of Jason and Gareth</h2><p>Here&#x2019;s the book that started it all&#x2014;Lloyd Alexander&#x2019;s first fantasy for young readers&#x2014;back in hardcover!<br><br>Gareth&#x2019;s definitely not an ordinary cat.

His books have won numerous awards, including the Newbery Medal, the Newbery Honor, and the National Book Award for Juvenile Literature.Chapter 1: The Visitors Gareth was a black cat with orange eyes. Sometimes, when he hunched his shoulders and put down his ears, he looked like an owl. When he stretched, he looked like a trickle of oil or a pair of black silk pajamas. When he sat on a window ledge, his eyes half-shut and his tail curled around him, he looked like a secret. He belonged to a boy named Jason, who loved him and believed Gareth could do anything in the world. As things turned out, Jason was right-not entirely, but almost. It happened this way. In the middle of a sunny afternoon, Jason sat in his room on the end of his bed, with his chin in his hands, and wished the past five minutes had never happened. Downstairs, in that space of time, he had accomplished the following: 1. Spilled paint on the dining-room table. 2. Dropped his model airplane and stepped on it. 3. Coated the inside of one pocket of his jacket with glue, when the tube he had been saving for emergencies had come uncapped. 4. Torn his shirt. 5. Punched his younger brother in the ribs for laughing at him. 6. Talked back to his mother, who had not agreed his brother needed punching. 7. Begun to cry, a thing Jason despised because he considered himself too old for it. There had been other details he preferred to forget. In any case, he had been told to go to his room, which he did, feeling put down and miserably sorry for himself. Gareth, who had been drowsing on top of Jason&#39;s pillow, uncurled and climbed onto the boy&#39;s lap. Jason stroked the cat and ran his finger over Gareth&#39;s only white spot-on his chest, a T-shaped mark with a loop over the crossbar. &#34;Lucky Gareth,&#34; Jason sighed, lying back and closing his eyes, &#34;I wish I had nine lives.&#34; The cat stopped purring. &#34;I wish I did, too,&#34; he said. Jason started up in surprise. Not because Gareth had spoken. Jason had always been sure he could if he wanted to. It was what Gareth had said. &#34;You mean you really don&#39;t have nine lives?&#34; Jason asked, disappointed. &#34;I&#39;m afraid not,&#39; said the cat, in a very matter-of-fact way. &#34;But, since you mention it, I&#39;ll tell you a secret. I only have one life. With a difference: I can visit.&#34; &#34;Visit?&#34; Jason said. &#34;Yes,&#34; Gareth went on, &#34;I can visit nine different lives. Anywhere, any time, any country, any century.&#34; &#34;Oh, Gareth!&#34; Jason clapped his hands. &#34;Can all cats do that?&#34; &#34;Where do you think cats go when you&#39;re looking all over and can&#39;t find them?&#34; Gareth replied. &#34;And have you ever noticed a cat suddenly appear in a room when you were sure the room was empty? Or disappear, and you can&#39;t imagine where he went?&#34; &#34;And you&#39;ve actually gone to a lot of different countries?&#34; Jason asked. No, not yet,&#34; Gareth said. &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for --- oh, I don&#39;t know, a special occasion, you might say. I never saw much sense in just going as a tourist. It&#39;s better to wait until there&#39;s some important reason.&#34; &#34;I guess you&#39;re right,&#34; Jason nodded. He looked over at Gareth. &#34;I was wondering if you thought there might be a special occasion coming up soon?&#34; &#34;There might be&#34; said Gareth. &#34;Gareth, listen,&#34; Jason said eagerly, &#34;if it were a special occasion and somebody else, somebody you liked, wanted very much to go, could you take him with you?&#34; Gareth did not answer immediately. He began looking like an owl and stayed that way for a while. Finally, he said. &#34;Yes, I suppose I could.&#34; &#34;Would you take me?&#34; Gareth was silent again. &#34;I could take you with me,&#34; he said, after a moment, &#34;but I have to warn you of this. You&#39;d be on your own, you wouldn&#39;t have any kind of protection. Neither of us would. Naturally, I&#39;d help you every way I could; we&#39;d be able to talk to each other, but only when no one else was around. Aside from that, what happens, happens. And you couldn&#39;t change your mind in the middle. &#34;Oh, there&#39;s something else. Whatever you did, you wouldn&#39;t dare be separated from me for any length of time. Otherwise, you&#39;d never see home again. Now, if you accept the conditions ... &#34;Oh, Gareth, I accept!&#34; &#34;Are you sure?&#34; the cat asked. &#34;Think carefully.&#34; Jason nodded. &#34;Very well,&#34; said the cat. &#34;Look into my eyes.&#34; And he gave Jason a long, slow wink. copyright (c) Lloyd Alexander, 1963; Published by Puffin Books, a member of Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.</p><h2>Be Faithful: How to Be Faithful to the Word, Your Tasks, and People Who Need You - 1-2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon</h2><p><p>OVER 3 MILLION &#x201c;BE&#x201d; BOOKS IN PRINT!<br> <br> It&#x2019;s Always Too Soon to Quit!<br> <br> Nothing in life can take the place of faithfulness.

Sent to Stalag 17, the infamous Nazi prison camp, Handy soon led an escape team determined to tunnel to freedom. Along with the unforgettable comrades he vividly describes, Handy worked relentlessly for months on a tunnel that was to prove instrumental in saving the lives of four fugitives sought by the Gestapo. One of those fugitives would become the only American ever to escape permanently from Stalag 17. The Flame Keepers is a vivid first-hand account of an American soldier&#39;s experience as a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany and a poignant portrait of the POWs who worked to survive within the wire and their German captors. Illustrated with original photographs taken inside the camp from a smuggled camera and published for the first time in the trade press, The Flame Keepers recounts one of World War II&#39;s great untold stories.</p><p>SHOT OUT OF THE SKY BY GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES...<br>In the Spring of 1944, Ned Handy's B-24 bomber was shot down on a mission into Germany.

As a master storyteller and thinker John Berger challenges readers to rethink their every assumption about the role of creativity in our lives.<br><br> In this brilliant collection of diverse pieces&#x2014;essays, short stories, poems, translations&#x2014;which spans a lifetime&#x2019;s engagement with art, John Berger reveals how he came to his own unique way of seeing. He pays homage to the writers and thinkers who infuenced him, such as Walter Benjamin, Rosa Luxemburg and Bertolt Brecht. His expansive perspective takes in artistic movements and individual artists&#x2014;from the Renaissance to the present&#x2014;while never neglecting the social and political context of their creation.<br><br> Berger pushes at the limits of art writing, demonstrating beautifully how his artist&#x2019;s eye makes him a storyteller in these essays, rather than a critic. With &#x201c;landscape&#x201d; as an animating, liberating metaphor rather than a rigid defnition, this collection surveys the aesthetic landscapes that have informed, challenged and nourished John Berger&#x2019;s understanding of the world. <i>Landscapes</i>&#x2014;alongside <i>Portraits</i>&#x2014;completes a tour through the history of art that will be an intellectual benchmark for many years to come.</p><p>Storyteller, novelist, essayist, screenwriter, dramatist and critic, <b>John Berger</b> is one of the most internationally influential writers of the last fifty years. His many books include <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, the fiction trilogy<i> Into Their Labours, Here Is Where We Meet,</i> the Booker Prize winning novel <i>G, Hold Everything Dear, </i>the Man Booker&#x2013;long-listed<i> From A to X</i> and <i>A Seventh Man.</i> <br><br><b> Tom Overton</b> catalogued John Berger&#x2019;s archive at the British Library. He has curated exhibitions at King&#x2019;s Cultural Institute, Somerset House and the Whitechapel Gallery, and his writing has been published by the <i>LRB</i> blog, <i>New Statesman, Apollo, White Review, Various Small Fires, </i>Tate<i>,</i> the British Council and others.&#x201c;Essential ...&nbsp;reminds us that all good writing comes only from good (that is, patient, attentive, loving) looking.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Andrew Marr, <i>New Statesman</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Berger&#x2019;s prose manifests an ethics of the committed gaze, a great sympathy for the human animal in pain and a great anger for the political conditions that extend that pain unnecessarily. As he wrote recently: &#x2018;What has prompted me to write over the years is the hunch that something needs to be told and that if I don&#x2019;t try to tell it, it risks not being told.&#x2019; The humbleness of the word &#x2018;hunch&#x2019; in that statement tells you all you need to know.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;John Douglas Millar, <i>Frieze</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Essential reading not just for our political moment but outside it. He was a monument, a world of his own; at the same time, his thinking and his art&#x2014;which are the same thing&#x2014;address themselves at once to the past, the present, and the future.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>n+1</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Life has more light and colour after an encounter with Berger.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Art Newspaper</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Berger is a masterful observer, a trait that lends his writing a profound element of artistry: these essays read like sketched studies of an as-yet-painted masterwork ...&nbsp;these worldly essays are timeless, inspiring works of critical observation.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i></b> <br><br><b> Praise for John Berger:</b><br><br> &#x201c;John Berger teaches us how to think, how to feel how to stare at things until we see what we thought wasn&#x2019;t there.

He worked for many years as a writer for game company Bio Ware, contributing to a number of games, including the Baldur&#39;s Gate series, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect and Star Wars: The Old Republic. His tie-in novels for the Star Wars and Mass Effect games have enjoyed huge success, and he is now focusing on writing full time and golfing.1<br><br> Dessel was lost in the suffering of his job, barely even aware of his surroundings. His arms ached from the endless pounding of the hydraulic jack. Small bits of rock skipped off the cavern wall as he bored through, ricocheting off his protective goggles and stinging his exposed face and hands. Clouds of atomized dust filled the air, obscuring his vision, and the screeching whine of the jack filled the cavern, drowning out all other sounds as it burrowed centimeter by agonizing centimeter into the thick vein of cortosis woven into the rock before him.<br><br> Impervious to both heat and energy, cortosis was prized in the construction of armor and shielding by both commercial and military interests, especially with the galaxy at war. Highly resistant to blaster bolts, cortosis alloys supposedly could withstand even the blade of a lightsaber. Unfortunately, the very properties that made it so valuable also made it extremely difficult to mine. Plasma torches were virtually useless; it would take days to burn away even a small section of cortosis-laced rock. The only effective way to mine it was through the brute force of hydraulic jacks pounding relentlessly away at a vein, chipping the cortosis free bit by bit.<br><br> Cortosis was one of the hardest materials in the galaxy. The force of the pounding quickly wore down the head of a jack, blunting it until it became almost useless. The dust clogged the hydraulic pistons, making them jam. Mining cortosis was hard on the equipment . . . and even harder on the miners.<br><br> Des had been hammering away for nearly six standard hours. The jack weighed more than thirty kilos, and the strain of keeping it raised and pressed against the rock face was taking its toll. His arms were trembling from the exertion. His lungs were gasping for air and choking on the clouds of fine mineral dust thrown up from the jack&#x2019;s head. Even his teeth hurt: the rattling vibration felt as if it were shaking them loose from his gums.<br><br> But the miners on Apatros were paid based on how much cortosis they brought back. If he quit now, another miner would jump in and start working the vein, taking a share of the profits. Des didn&#x2019;t like to share.<br><br> The whine of the jack&#x2019;s motor took on a higher pitch, becoming a keening wail Des was all too familiar with. At twenty thousand rpm, the motor sucked in dust like a thirsty bantha sucking up water after a long desert crossing. The only way to combat it was by regular cleaning and servicing, and the Outer Rim Oreworks Company preferred to buy cheap equipment and replace it, rather than sinking credits into maintenance. Des knew exactly what was going to happen next&#x2014;and a second later, it did. The motor blew.<br><br> The hydraulics seized with a horrible crunch, and a cloud of black smoke spit out the rear of the jack. Cursing ORO and its corporate policies, Des released his cramped finger from the trigger and tossed the spent piece of equipment to the floor.<br><br> &#x201c;Move aside, kid,&#x201d; a voice said.<br><br> Gerd, one of the other miners, stepped up and tried to shoulder Des out of the way so he could work the vein with his own jack. Gerd had been working the mines for nearly twenty standard years, and it had turned his body into a mass of hard, knotted muscle. But Des had been working the mines for ten years himself, ever since he was a teenager, and he was just as solid as the older man&#x2014;and a little bigger. He didn&#x2019;t budge.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not done here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Jack died, that&#x2019;s all. Hand me yours and I&#x2019;ll keep at it for a while.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know the rules, kid. You stop working and someone else is allowed to move in.&#x201d;<br><br> Technically, Gerd was right. But nobody ever jumped another miner&#x2019;s claim over an equipment malfunction. Not unless he was trying to pick a fight.<br><br> Des took a quick look around. The chamber was empty except for the two of them, standing less than half a meter apart. Not a surprise; Des usually chose caverns far off the main tunnel network. It had to be more than mere coincidence that Gerd was here.<br><br> Des had known Gerd for as long as he could remember. The middle-aged man had been friends with Hurst, Des&#x2019;s father. Back when Des first started working the mines at thirteen, he had taken a lot of abuse from the bigger miners. His father had been the worst tormentor, but Gerd had been one of the main instigators, dishing out more than his fair share of teasing, insults, and the occasional cuff on the ear.<br><br> Their harassments had ended shortly after Des&#x2019;s father died of a massive heart attack. It wasn&#x2019;t because the miners felt sorry for the orphaned young man, though. By the time Hurst died, the tall, skinny teenager they loved to bully had become a mountain of muscle with heavy hands and a fierce temper. Mining was a tough job; it was the closest thing to hard labor outside a Republic prison colony. Whoever worked the mines on Apatros got big&#x2014;and Des just happened to become the biggest of them all. Half a dozen black eyes, countless bloody noses, and one broken jaw in the space of a month was all it took for Hurst&#x2019;s old friends to decide they&#x2019;d be happier if they left Des alone.<br><br> Yet it was almost as if they blamed him for Hurst&#x2019;s death, and every few months one of them tried again. Gerd had always been smart enough to keep his distance&#x2014;until now.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any of your friends here with you, old man,&#x201d; Des said. &#x201c;So back off my claim, and nobody gets hurt.&#x201d;<br><br> Gerd spat on the ground at Des&#x2019;s feet. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know what day it is, do you, boy? Kriffing disgrace is what you are!&#x201d;<br><br> They were standing close enough to each other that Des could smell the sour Corellian whiskey on Gerd&#x2019;s breath. The man was drunk. Drunk enough to come looking for a fight, but still sober enough to hold his own.<br><br> &#x201c;Five years ago today,&#x201d; Gerd said, shaking his head sadly. &#x201c;Five years ago today your own father died, and you don&#x2019;t even remember!&#x201d;<br><br> Des rarely even thought about his father anymore. He hadn&#x2019;t been sorry to see him go. His earliest memories were of his father smacking him. He didn&#x2019;t even remember the reason; Hurst rarely needed one.<br><br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say I miss Hurst the same way you do, Gerd.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hurst?&#x201d; Gerd snorted. &#x201c;He raised you by himself after your mama died, and you don&#x2019;t even have the respect to call him Dad? You ungrateful son-of-a-Kath-hound!&#x201d;<br><br> Des glared down menacingly at Gerd, but the shorter man was too full of drink and self-righteous indignation to be intimidated.<br><br> &#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve expected this from a mudcrutch whelp like you,&#x201d; Gerd continued. &#x201c;Hurst always said you were no good. He knew there was something wrong with you . . . Bane.&#x201d;<br><br> Des narrowed his eyes, but didn&#x2019;t rise to the bait. Hurst had called him by that name when he was drunk. Bane. He had blamed his son for his wife&#x2019;s death. Blamed him for being stuck on Apatros. He considered his only child to be the bane of his existence, a fact he&#x2019;d tended to spit out at Des in his drunken rages.<br><br> Bane. It represented everything spiteful, petty, and mean about his father. It struck at the innermost fears of every child: fear of disappointment, fear of abandonment, fear of violence. As a kid, that name had hurt more than all the smacks from his father&#x2019;s heavy fists. But Des wasn&#x2019;t a kid anymore. Over time he&#x2019;d learned to ignore it, along with all the rest of the hateful bile that spilled from his father&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time for this,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got work to do.&#x201d;<br><br> With one hand he grabbed the hydraulic jack from Gerd&#x2019;s grasp. He put the other hand on Gerd&#x2019;s shoulder and shoved him away. Stumbling back, the inebriated man caught his heel on a rock and fell roughly to the ground.<br><br> He stood up with a snarl, his hands balling into fists. &#x201c;Guess your daddy&#x2019;s been gone too long, boy. You need someone to beat the sense back into you!&#x201d;<br><br> Gerd was drunk, but he was no fool, Des realized. Des was bigger, stronger, younger . . . but he&#x2019;d spent the last six hours working a hydraulic jack. He was covered in grime and the sweat was dripping off his face. His shirt was drenched. Gerd&#x2019;s uniform, on the other hand, was still relatively clean: no dust, no sweat stains. He must have been planning this all day, taking it easy and sitting back while Des wore himself out.<br><br> But Des wasn&#x2019;t about to back down from a fight. Throwing Gerd&#x2019;s jack to the ground, he dropped into a crouch, feet wide and arms held out in front of him.<br><br> Gerd charged forward, swinging his right fist in a vicious uppercut. Des reached out and caught the punch with the open palm of his left hand, absorbing the force of the blow. His right hand snapped forward and grabbed the underside of Gerd&#x2019;s right wrist; as he pulled the older man forward, Des ducked down and turned, driving his shoulder into Gerd&#x2019;s chest. Using his opponent&#x2019;s own momentum against him, Des straightened up and yanked hard on Gerd&#x2019;s wrist, flipping him up and over so that he crashed to the ground on his back.<br><br> The fight should have ended right then; Des had a split second where he could have dropped his knee onto his opponent, driving the breath from his lungs and pinning him to the ground while he pounded Gerd with his fists. But it didn&#x2019;t happen. His back, exhausted from hours of hefting the thirty-kilo jack, spasmed.<br><br> The pain was agonizing; instinctively Des straightened up, clutching at the knotted lumbar muscles.

Two hours later, <i>Yorktown</i> received word from Admiral Nimitz that the war had ended and that all offensive operations should cease. As they were turning back, twenty Japanese planes suddenly dove from the sky above them and began a ferocious attack. Four American pilots never returned--men who had lifted off from the carrier in wartime but were shot down during peacetime.<br><br>Drawing on participant letters, diaries, and interviews, newspaper and radio accounts, and previously untapped archival records, historian and prolific author of acclaimed Pacific theater books, including <i>Tin Can Titans</i> and <i>Hell from the Heavens</i>, John Wukovits tells the story of Air Group 88's pilots and crew through their eyes. <i>Dogfight over Tokyo</i> is written in the same riveting, edge-of-your-seat style that has made Wukovits's previous books so successful. This is a stirring, one-of-a-kind tale of naval encounters and the last dogfight of the war--a story that is both inspirational and tragic.</p><p><b>John Wukovits</b> is a military expert specializing in the Pacific theater of World War II.

With more than 250 recipes, including appetizers, sauces, sides, main dishes, and delectable desserts, it'll keep you cookin'. <p> She's definitely taken a gourmet approach to the recipes. While they're all tempting, notables include Three-Grain Pancakes with Raspberry-Orange Sauce, Nut-Crusted Swordfish with Romesco Sauce, and Cr�me Fra�che Ice Cream. Unlike the many other low-carb cookbooks out there, McCullough gives advice for tracking down the best prepared food products and additional tips for healthy food preparation (for example, she recommends organic meat and dairy products whenever possible and cautions that "free-range" chickens are allowed to stick their heads out of their cages--not necessarily given the chance to frolic freely on the farm). There's also an interesting comparison of low-carb books, including <i>Protein Power</i>, <i>Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution</i>, <i>The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet</i>, and <i>The Zone</i>, which boils down to this: they all emulate many aspects of the Overeater's Anonymous recommended diet.

Yet, beneath &#39;the brilliant and vivacious surface&#39;, what are the realities of Italian life? Few writers have ever painted a portrait of their compatriots as crisp, frank and fearless as Luigi Barzini&#39;s. Cutting through the familiar cliches, he instructs us with a cascade of anecdotes and provides a marvelous guided tour through centuries of history. He examines Machiavelli and Mussolini, popes, pilgrims and prostitutes, cliques and conspiracies, Casanova and the crippling power of the Church. Yet alongside the Baroque exuberance and spectacular display, the love of life and the life of love, he also shows us a divided nation, injustice, ignorance, poverty and fear. All this is Italy, a country of dazzling achievement and an uncanny aptitude for getting round problems; both its virtues and its vices are celebrated in this sparkling book.</p><p>Luigi Barzini, was born in Milan, Italy, in 1908. After completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia University, he worked for two New York newspapers. He returned to Italy in 1930 to become a correspondent for <i>Corriere della Sera.</i> In 1940 he was confined by the Fascists. With the Allied liberation he returned to publishing and founded <i>Il Globo.</i> Subsequently he served as the chief editor of several newspapers and magazines. His books include <i>Americans Are Alone in the World</i> (1958), <i>From Caesar to the Mafia</i> (1971), and <i>Peking to Paris</i> (1973). He died in 1984.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><i>THE PEACEFUL INVASION</i><br><br>Italians are pleased and perplexed. Every year since the end of the war they have seen the number of foreign visitors to their country increase at an incredibly rapid rate. The phenomenon has now reached unprecedented, practically inexplicable, and almost alarming proportions. In the 1950s the tourists numbered eight, ten, twelve million yearly. A little later, only yesterday, they were fifteen, seventeen, nineteen million. They have now passed the twenty million mark, a proportion of more than one tourist to every two and a half Italians, and the total is still growing. It appears that, if circumstances remain favourable, the travellers will reach thirty million within a decade, and will eventually match and even surpass the number of native inhabitants in the peninsula. Nothing daunts foreigners. Nothing frightens them. Nothing stops them. They arrive in a steady stream, by all forms of transport and even on foot, by day and night, from the sea or via the Alps. What is but a small trickle in the winter months grows in the spring to the size of a stream, and, in April, May, and June, turns into a monsoon flood, breaking all dikes, covering everything in sight. It begins to recede in September. It never completely dries up.<br><br>People come from all parts of the five known continents, from the old established nations of Europe and America and from the newly founded ones in Africa and Asia. The largest number come from the north, the vast, democratic, bourgeois, industrial north of Europe and America. Some now also come from Russia, in some ways the most northerly of all countries, organized parties of sightseers, behaving like military units traversing a dangerous territory inhabited by treacherous natives, as diffident and self-contained as Xenophon's Greeks marching across Asia Minor. Russian tourists all wear the same box-like clothes, as new as those of provincial newly-weds, and ankle-length raincoats. They look well-fed, self-satisfied, and well-behaved. They appear eager to acquire as much culture, in all its forms, as rapidly and cheaply as possible. They have a disturbing resemblance to the diligent German tourists at the beginning of the century, the solid subjects of William II.<br><br>There are many travellers who, in order to obey the urge that drives them south, abandon their own countries, whose delights and tourist attractions are being advertised and celebrated all over the world. What do they seek that is better than what they left behind? Not many Italians willingly travel abroad in any direction, north, south, east or west. They always feel more or less exiled and unhappy in alien lands, and honestly believe the attractions of their homeland to be most satisfying. They are the first victims of the famous charm of Italy, never satiated with her sights, climate, food, music and life. Familiarity never breeds contempt in them. Neapolitans, for instance, after many thousand years, still gaze with the same rapture on their native landscape, eat <i>spaghetti alle vongole</i> as if they had never tasted them before, and compose endless songs dedicated to the immortal beauty of their women and their bay. Those Italians who travel abroad are, as a rule, the privileged -- Milanese industrialists and Roman princes who have adopted foreign ways, cabinet ministers, diplomats, newly-weds -- and the disinherited who go looking for work. They are usually all equally homesick abroad; the rich and the poor look for <i>caff� espresso,</i> a good Italian restaurant, wherever they go, and sigh for the day of their return.<br><br>At the high tide of the tourist season, from early June till late September, visitors fill every empty space available in Italy. Trains, buses, boats, restaurants, churches, museums, Greek and Roman ruins, chapels, concert halls, historic landmarks, and famous belvederes, whence romantic landscapes (two stars in the guide books) can be admired, are packed to capacity with foreigners. One literally finds them everywhere, often at one's table, unknown friends of friends, sometimes even in one's bathroom and bed. They also fill a couple of universities, Perugia and Urbino, set aside for them, where they study the language, imbibe the Latin sun-drenched culture, make love, go swimming, and feed themselves cheaply on pasta, olive oil, tomatoes, and garlic. American universities sometimes hold summer sessions, in art appreciation, history of civilization, and related subjects, in some ancient villa on a hill-top near Florence with a view over the whole city, or a <i>palazzo</i> on the Grand Canal. Swedish and Norwegian workers' clubs have purchased wooded strips of deserted Italian coastline, where they have built their own club-houses and recreation centres.<br><br>There are sultry days in July and August when the cities, emptied by the natives, are almost completely taken over by the swarms of dusty and perspiring foreigners. During the siesta hour, when even the carriage horses sleep under their straw hats, the relentless tourists finally slow down. They bivouac everywhere. They recline on park benches, kerbstones, the stone brims of fountains, or ancient ruins. They place their heads over their crossed arms on caf� tables for a siesta among the empty bottles, the dirty napkins, and the recently purchased souvenirs. They then really look like a tired and bedraggled army after a fatiguing battle, who have occupied a city abandoned by their fleeing enemy. They have conquered. The place is theirs.<br><br>I am not talking here of the minority, the experienced foreigners who know why they come to Italy and what Italy is. Many have come here before and know their way about, others have never been here but somehow know what to do and what they want. They all avoid the heat and the dust, seldom visit the obvious places but, when they have to (the obvious places are often the most desirable), they go at convenient hours, when the crowd is away and the air is cool. They wear ordinary clothes, the same as everybody else. Some are in love with nature, others with art, culture, archaeology, or music. Some like meeting people and making friends, others discover little-known beaches or unexplored islands. There are those who make lengthy detours, to see some little-known masterpiece, and those who like food and wine and know the <i>trattorie</i> which only few natives and no foreigners have yet discovered. There are many who speak the language well. These easily disappear in the background. They do not interest me here. There is nothing peculiar about them. I am talking of the vast majority of tourists, the millions driven by some unknown urge.<br><br>They are so punctual and numerous that their mass arrival, in the eyes of ordinary Italians, appears as irresistible as a natural event, as ineluctable as the seasonal return of migratory birds, swallows, quails, or partridges, driven by instinct; or as an anthropological phenomenon like the migration of nomadic tribes seeking green pastures for their herds. The impression is heightened by the fact that many of these travellers look somewhat alike to Italian eyes. They dress in garishly-coloured clothes, much as the members of the ancient barbaric hordes once did and as the Gipsies and Berbers still do. A great number of Germans, Scandinavians, Britons, and Dutch have pink skins, which the sun seldom succeeds in tanning a decent brown but reddens to the tender colour of <i>prosciutto</i> or covers with freckles. They perspire freely in the heat, under their nylon shirts. They wear barbaric sandals. They have dark glasses over their eyes and their heads are bare or covered with cheap straw hats on whose brims are printed or embroidered the names of cities, sanctuaries, beaches, islands, or other famous landmarks.<br><br>There is something mysteriously significant about the behaviour of many of them. A mild frenzy takes most of them and transforms them once across the Italian border. It resembles the irresistible excitement which captures some living organisms and makes them forget themselves and everything else, when, like salmon going upstream, they obey some deep and secret impulse of Nature; or the intoxication, the gentle and sweet delirium, which makes all honeymooners quietly mad everywhere in the world and honeymooners in Italy doubly so, both because they are on their honeymoon and they are in Italy. Like all newly-weds, in fact, many ordinary travellers seem deliciously drunk with new illusions and hopes. The sedate professional man, the sober shopkeeper, the loyal employee, the rigorous scientist, the stern educator, the tidy housewife, the bespectacled spinster, the innocent maiden, the virtuous wife, the resigned husband, all behave as they probably never dared to behave before and as they probably would not behave publicly in their native habitat. More exactly, they behave as if they had shed the r�les assigned to them and the personalities bestowed on them by Nature, because such r�les and personalities had suddenly become repugnant and alien to them; or as if all the rules of the game of life had been changed or suspended. Some seem strangely deprived of all, or part of, their customary discernment, of their powers of control and discrimination, and of the scepticism, diffidence, prudence, suspicion, and fear necessary for survival in most countries. They get into all sorts of scrapes. They make friends with all sorts of people. They look at all things with indulgent and dewy eyes, apparently ready to love, admire, understand, or, at least, excuse and forgive almost everything, the good, the bad, the indifferent, the repugnant. They are often easily swindled, but many do not always mind if they are.<br><br>Most of these visitors from Northern Europe drink vast and indiscriminate quantities of wine. They drink, with equal good-natured enthusiasm, anything at all: costly vintages from famous vineyards, raw wines still smelling of sulphur and wooden staves, sweet and syrupy wines made for people who know little about such things. It is, for some curious reason, the first thing Germans and Austrians do, as soon as they cross the Brenner pass on their southward trip. They stop the car at one of the many wineshops which line both sides of the valley road, just beyond the border, as frequent as the petrol stations. Each <i>osteria</i> has a wrought-iron hanging sign, a terrace in the quivering shadow of a leafy pergola, checked table-cloths, waitresses in <i>dirndl,</i> everything designed in a tasteful fairy-story style, a style which is a mixture suited to the geographical and psychological spot, half German and half Italian, half Walt-Disney-Tyrolean and half <i>Il Trovatore</i> or Palio-di-Siena-Medieval. On the Brenner road, German and Austrian tourists behave as the Americans did under prohibition, when they rushed for the first bar across the Canadian border. There is no obvious explanation for this phenomenon. There is no scarcity of cheap wines, local or imported, in Germany and Austria. Perhaps these people are trying to quench not a physiological but a psychological thirst. This may be an unconscious magic rite; they drink wine as if it were a potion necessary to acquire a new personality, or they drink it as one drinks champagne on New Year's eve, on the stroke of midnight, to celebrate the crossing of a spiritual border and to inaugurate new hopes and a new life.<br><br>With equal indulgent enthusiasm, these summer visitors indiscriminately enjoy all kinds of doubtful attractions, things they probably shunned at home. They listen with the same breathless rapture and delighted smiles to the best opera singing in the world at Rome, Milan, or Spoleto, and to wheezy village bands, to impeccable Vivaldi quartets and to tinny dance orchestras. They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes, mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes, or fisherman's octopus and shrimps, fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach. They buy vast quantities of souvenirs to take home, smart things they cannot find elsewhere, cheap trinkets made in Japan, costly masterpieces, tawdry imitations.<br><br>Many try to speak Italian. A few creditably manage this in a short time. Others think they do. Things seem, of course, more significant and enjoyable when expressed in the native language. A spade is only a spade, a <i>Shaufel</i> but a <i>Shaufel,</i> but a <i>badile</i> cannot help being a pagan, Mediteranean, intoxicating <i>badile.</i> Some study lists of words phonetically spelled in handbooks. Some pick them up in random conversations. They also try hard to gesticulate wildly as they speak. They usually manage it in the style of amateur comedians playing an Italian character. They laugh loudly and converse with everybody, the people at the next table, travelling companions in the trains, the waiters, the beggars, the street singers, the cicerones, anybody in sight, with the same good-natured lack of discrimination with which dog lovers pet any dog.<br><br>The men, many men at least, those of all ages who have a natural bent for that sort of thing, admire and pursue Italian girls. It must be said that the Italian girls and young women, for reasons nobody knows for sure, are now more disturbingly beautiful than they have ever been in men's memory and perhaps in history, certainly more attractive and desirable than the models of the most famous statues and paintings in the past; Botticelli's 'Venus', Titian's 'Sacred Love', and Raphael's 'Fornarina' would not make anybody turn around in the streets. Italian girls are more attractive, and approachable, not only than in the past but also than in many other countries today. Feminine beauty, before the war, like prosperity, seemed to be a privilege reserved to rare local cases, but widespread among many foreigners, especially Americans. Smart Italian young men of the time anxiously awaited the disembarking of the American girls in the spring, well-shaped, well-washed, well-dressed, and incredibly long-legged, who always looked as if they really arrived from another and younger world. They were healthy, witty, free, and unafraid. Now our women, too, have somehow surprisingly acquired long and shapely legs; they have lovely and pert faces, overbearing breasts, thin waists, and harmonious behinds like double mandolins. But, more than this, they have simple, unembarrassed, friendly manners: they can say tender words with heart-breaking candour or, at times, prettily pronounce unprintable ones.<br><br>Foreign men, it is true, have always pursued women in Italy. The courtesans of Venice and Rome during the Renaissance were much appreciated. The Carnival season in Rome and Venice was for centuries merely an excuse to chase masked girls through the streets. Now the hunt has acquired a more determined, almost desperate, character. Many visitors are fascinated by the girls to the point that they often lose all powers of coherent speech and judgment: they are bewitched by the girls' sinuous and provocative walk, their inviting and hospitable ways, their smart clothes which often look as if they are sewn on them, or, more especially, their tiny two-piece bathing suits. Foreign men sometimes follow some specially provocative specimens in the street like hungry dogs following butcher boys delivering meat. Striking up an acquaintance is not always difficult, in a <i>caff�</i> or on the beach. Many men easily, too easily perhaps, find their way to some girl's bedroom. Some of these always fall deeply in love. They earnestly want to get married. They want to bring back a living souvenir of the land of sunshine and amiable ways to their gloomy countries. At the end of every summer, there are men who threaten suicide (a few kill themselves), for the love of a beautiful woman, wit...</p><h2>Art and Queer Culture</h2><p>* A comprehensive survey covering 125 years of art that has constructed, contested or otherwise responded to alternative forms of sexuality.

As the next presidential election comes into view, Americans are deciding where to stand on the key issues. The church has often been as politically divided as the culture, leading many Christians to withdraw from politics or to declare alliances prematurely. But Charles Drew offers an alternative for people who care deeply about their faith and about the church&#39;s corporate calling in the world. In this updated and revised version of A Public Faith (NavPress 2000), Drew helps Christians to develop practical biblical convictions about critical social and political issues. Carefully distinguishing between moral principle and political strategy, Body Broken equips believers to build their political activism upon a thoughtful and biblical foundation. This balanced approach will provide readers Democrats, Republicans, or Independents with a solid biblical foundation for decision making. Drew even helps Christians of all political persuasions to understand how they can practice servanthood, cooperation and integrity in today&#39;s public square. With questions at the end of each chapter to help readers explore and apply principles, Body Broken will train believers to actively engage with political issues while standing united as a church.</p><p>Charles D.

Drawing on authoritative materials not previously available, including thousands of hours of tape-recorded allied councils of war, award-winning military historian Lewis Sorley has given us what has long been needed-an insightful, factual, and superbly documented history of these important years. Among his findings is that the war was being won on the ground even as it was being lost at the peace table and in the U.S. Congress. The story is a great human drama of purposeful and principled service in the face of an agonizing succession of lost opportunities, told with uncommon understanding and compassion. Sorley documents the dramatic differences in conception, conduct, and-at least for a time-results between the early and the later war. Meticulously researched and movingly told, A Better War is sure to stimulate controversy as it sheds brilliant new light on the war in Vietnam.<br></p><p>There was a moment when the United States had the Vietnam War wrapped up, writes military historian Lewis Sorley (biographer of two Vietnam-era U.S. Army generals, Creighton Abrams and Harold Johnson). "The fighting wasn't over, but the war was won," he says in this convention-shaking book. "This achievement can probably best be dated in late 1970." South Vietnam was ready to carry on the battle without American ground troops and only logistical and financial support. Sorley says that replacing General Westmoreland with Abrams in 1968 was the key. "The tactics changed within fifteen minutes of Abrams's taking command," remarked one officer. Abrams switched the war aims from destruction to control; he was less interested in counting enemy body bags than in securing South Vietnam's villages.<p> <i>A Better War</i> is unique among histories of the Vietnam War in that it focuses on the second half of the conflict, roughly from Abrams's arrival to the fall of Saigon in 1975. Other volumes, such as Stanley Karnow's <i>Vietnam</i> and Neil Sheehan's <i>A Bright Shining Lie</i>, tend to give short shrift to this period. Sorley shows how the often-overlooked Abrams strategy nearly succeeded--indeed, Sorley says it did succeed, at least until political leadership in the United States let victory slip away. Sorley cites other problems, too, such as low morale among troops in the field, plus the harmful effects of drug abuse, racial disharmony, and poor discipline. In the end, the mighty willpower of Abrams and diplomatic allies Ellsworth Bunker and William Colby was not enough. But, with its strong case that they came pretty close to winning, <i>A Better War</i> is sure to spark controversy. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>How <i>A Better War</i> Came to Be Written: When General Creighton W. Abrams returned in 1972 to become Army Chief of Staff, he brought with him certain highly classified materials relating to his service in Vietnam. Then when, in the autumn of 1974, Abrams died while still in office, his successor, General Frederick C. Weyand, ordered that these materials be sequestered, with both their existence and location treated as classified information. Eventually, however, I learned of these materials from sources in the Army hierarchy who were friendly to my work. With the invaluable help of the Army's Chief of Military History, I was granted access to the "Abrams Special Collection" by the Army Chief of Staff (coincidentally the only Armor officer other than General Abrams to have held that post). After certain other agencies sharing a security interest in the materials concurred, I commenced research in these holdings. Thus began what turned out to be a year-long endeavor. The collection was housed in a secure facility at Carlisle Barracks, some two hours from where I resided. Beginning in May 1994 I departed home at 5:30 a.m. each Monday morning, getting to Carlisle Barracks by the time the vault opened for the day's business. There I typically spent a ten-hour day working with the materials until the vault closed in late afternoon. In the evenings I used the fine library of the U.S. Army War College, also located at Carlisle Barracks. My home away from home for each week was a modest but friendly motel frequented primarily by drivers of eighteen-wheeler trucking rigs. Friday evenings I would, after the day's work, make my way back home. This routine continued for an entire year of weekdays, interrupted only by holidays and other occasions on which the vault was not open, and by a one-week respite for our family's annual beach outing. The heart of the collection turned out to be 455 tape recordings made at Headquarters, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, during the four years General Abrams was in command. Of the old reel-to-reel variety, these tapes ran two to six hours in length, and I used up or wore out three ancient machines in the process of screening them all. Keeping these machines limping along or finding successors when they finally collapsed was no small part of the process. In the final weeks the last machine was kept going only through use of a wooden jig, inserted to hold the worn-out play lever in place. Listening to these tapes and making handwritten single-spaced notes that eventually ran to nearly 3,200 pages was a laborious and time-consuming process, but also a fascinating one, for I never knew what the next tape would reveal. What emerged was a portrait of a senior commander and his closest associates-something like Napoleon and his marshals-working together to prosecute a complex and challenging military campaign in an equally complex and difficult political context. The interchanges were candid, spirited, often funny, and included not only what were called the Weekly Intelligence Estimate Updates-Saturday morning sessions held at MACV Headquarters-but also many sessions conducted for such visitors as the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, and consultant Sir Robert Thompson. In May 1995, almost exactly a year after I began, my screening of these materials was complete. It took most of another year to get the notes through the mandatory declassification review process by the Army, the National Security Agency, and the Central Intelligence Agency. Even so I needed the absolutely invaluable assistance of three senior officers who are also valued and long-time friends to reach a favorable outcome.<p>Once the cleared notes had been returned to me, it took over two months of more or less non-stop work to enter them-nearly 835,000 words in all-in a computer. Many other public records and private recollections yielded valuable research material. Over the past decade and a half I have interviewed about 500 people, many of them repeatedly, for this book and the two preceding biographies of Generals Creighton Abrams and Harold K. Johnson, some of them repeatedly, and worked my way through the papers of both men. Now, however, I was privileged to be the first researcher ever granted access to the fascinating, authentic, and extensive collection of materials on these tapes. Each day brought something new, and in the aggregate the story that emerged provided many new insights and much significant evidence concerning conduct of the war during the later years by Abrams, Bunker and Colby. It was a treasure trove indeed, so much so that it is my intention to publish an extensive volume of excerpts from the notes I compiled, thereby making available to other researchers the most interesting and historically significant portions of this rich historical record.</p></p><h2>NKJV Tim LaHaye Prophecy Study Bible, Hardcover</h2><p>Under the direction of Tim LaHaye comes a library of wisdom and insight from over 48 leading Bible experts of prophecy.</p><p></p><h2>The New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook</h2><p>A must have for those that want REAL food</p><p></p><h2>Hugh Lofting&#39;s Travels of Doctor Dolittle</h2><p>Synopsis coming soon.......</p><p>Illus. in full color.

No one in town will let him forget that he's a minister's son, even if he doesn't act like one. But then he meets Lizzie Bright Griffin, a smart and sassy girl from a poor nearby island community founded by former slaves. Despite his father's-and the town's-disapproval of their friendship, Turner spends time with Lizzie, and it opens up a whole new world to him, filled with the mystery and wonder of Maine's rocky coast. The two soon discover that the town elders, along with Turner's father, want to force the people to leave Lizzie's island so that Phippsburg can start a lucrative tourist trade there. Turner gets caught up in a spiral of disasters that alter his life-but also lead him to new levels of acceptance and maturity. This sensitively written historical novel, based on the true story of a community's destruction, highlights a unique friendship during a time of change. Author's note.<br></p><p><b>Gary D. Schmidt</b> is the best-selling author of <i>Pay Attention, Carter Jones;&nbsp;</i><i>Orbiting Jupiter;&nbsp;</i>the Newbery Honor and Printz Honor book <i>Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy;</i>&nbsp;the Newbery Honor book <i>The Wednesday Wars;&nbsp;</i>and <i>Okay for Now</i>. He&nbsp;is a professor of English at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.Boston and Phippsburg are close geographically, but 13-year-old Tucker Buckminster, who moves to Maine with his minister father, discovers they are two different worlds. He tries to fit in but the door is firmly shut until he finds friendship with old Mrs. Heard and sprightly Lizzie Bright. From the beginning, Sam Freed portrays Tucker as open, caring, and honest as he faces his new life. Freed doesn't differentiate the many characters, but his Maine accent is superb. Freed superbly conveys Tucker's innocence and na�vet� as he faces prejudice, his wonder and awe at communing with the whales, and finally his growing strength of character and sense of self. Very fine!

The New Work (i.e., the network) takes off, with a mini-startup in every abandoned strip mall in America. But suddenly, it crashes, and things get really interesting. Lester and Perry build an interactive ride in an abandoned Wal-Mart, a nostalgia trip through their glory days, that catches the eye of a vicious Disney exec&#x2014;and the old corporate giants fight their last battle against the new economic order. Doctorow&#x2019;s talent for imagining the near future is astonishing, and his novels keep getting better. His prognostications are unnervingly plausible and completely bizarre, obviously developed from careful observation of what&#x2019;s going on at the bleeding edge of technology and culture. The characters are simultaneously completely geeky and suave, lovable and flawed.

The Hollow Hills is the brilliant portrayal of the young Arthur from his birth to accession to the throne of Britain. And behind and around him is the strong, yet vulnerable figure of Merlin who sees and knows so much but is powerless to prevent the strife and violence of his turbulent times.The Hollow Hills was first published in 1973 and tells the story of Merlin&#39;s guardianship of Arthur. He leads Arthur to the sword that tests his claim to power and the crown.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t read Mary Stewart&#39;s Arthurian Saga, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

World War II is bringing an end to so many things, but the Marlings carry on as best they can in the face of rationing and changed living conditions. Into their world erupt Geoffrey Harvey and his sister Frances, bombed out of their London home. Bohemian and sophisticated, they rent a local house and it is not long before they begin to have an effect on their neighbors. Geoffrey begins to court Lettice, the Marlings&#39; older widowed daughter, but he finds he has rivals for her affections in her cousin David Lindsey and Captain Barclay. Observing everything and quietly keeping events on an even keel is Miss Bunting. Observing everything and quietly keeping events on an even keel is Miss Bunting.</p><p>This dry comedy of manners, set in a parochial England that was rapidly disappearing under the threat of Nazi Germany, was the first of Thirkell&#39;s increasingly dark novels written during World War II. But the placid surface of middle-class life in towns such as Marling Melicent--where a bohemian, faintly disreputable brother and sister suddenly appear and rent an Edwardian manor--remains mostly undisturbed. Thirkell, who portrayed a vanishing England, is enjoying something of a revival with many of her 40-odd novels being reprinted in the United States.Angela Thirkell (1890-1961) was the eldest daughter of John William Mackail, a Scottish classical scholar and civil servant, and Margaret Burne-Jones. Her relatives included the pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin, and her grandfather was J. M. Barrie. She was educated in London and Paris, and began publishing articles and stories in the 1920s. In 1931 she brought out her first book, a memoir entitled<i> Three Houses</i>, and in 1933 her comic novel <i>High Rising</i> - set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, borrowed from Trollope - met with great success. She went on to write nearly thirty Barsetshire novels, as well as several further works of fiction and non-fiction. She was twice married and had four children.</p><h2>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to the Path of Ascension (Ascension Series, Book 7) (Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path)</h2><p>This volume covers the basics of ascension clearly and completely, from the spiritual hierarchy to the angels and star beings, in Dr. Stone's easy-to-read style.

So Gunter Koschorrek, a fresh young recruit, wrote his notes on whatever scraps of paper he could find and sewed the pages into the lining of his winter coat. Left with his mother on his rare trips home, this illicit diary eventually was lost� and did not come to light until some 40 years later when Koschorrek was reunited with his daughter in America. It is this remarkable document, a unique day-to-day account of the common German soldier&#x2019;s experience, that makes up the memoir that is Blood Red Snow.</p><p>Gunther K. Koschorrek was a machine-gunner on the Russian front in WWII. He lives in Germany, having retired from his job as managing director of a sales company.This memoir is the first-person account of a German soldier who served on the eastern front during World War II. The author is not concerned with examining the reasons for the war or the tactics used to fight it. Rather, he sets out to present the day-to-day realities of the German soldiers by naming them and then relating their fates, which too often was violent death. Many of Koschorrek's compatriots were run over by Soviet tanks or blown to pieces by Soviet shells. This memoir by a former German soldier is reminiscent of accounts by American GIs, such as Charles Reis Felix's recent Crossing the Sauer. For capturing so unsparingly the banality and horror of war, this book is highly recommended for large public and academic libraries. Robert J.

Unlike the better established regions of Burgundy and Bordeaux, the small grape growers of Beaujolais&#x2014;a ribbon of land between Lyon and M�con, its capital Beaujeu&#x2014;held to the growing of the inferior gamay, which flourished in the region despite the attempts by the Romans to eradicate it.

While some people repeat the mantra "I'm OK, you're OK," it is much wiser to conclude, "I'm a mess, you're a mess." The good news is that, like the Prodigal Son, we aren't left standing at the pig trough. God sees us from a distance, runs to greet us, embraces us in love, and celebrates our arrival. The ballad of sin is not so much a dirge as it is a prelude to grace. Facing our sin ultimately ushers us into the presence of Grace, where we find forgiveness, mercy, hope, and celebration.</p><p></p><h2>The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward A Critique of Marxist Aesthetics</h2><p>Developing a concept briefly introduced in <i>Counterrevolution and Revolt</i>, Marcuse here addresses the shortcomings of Marxist aesthetic theory and explores a dialectical aesthetic in which art functions as the conscience of society.

None of the national championships, the bowl games, fame, glory, and power that came from lording over college football would ever shake Hayes's firm belief that all that was right in the world came from rural America, where love of country, hard work, and loyalty made America great.It was this philosophy that would send Hayes to speak at nearly every Elks club, Masonic lodge, and Moose hall that asked, giving him the chance to lecture his audience on the virtues of small-town life. In return Hayes would be honored with a key to the city, a chicken dinner, and a modest speaking fee. The fee invariably would never see the inside of his pocket. Instead, he often would donate the money back to the club, or sign the check over to the local high school football team that was invariably in need of new equipment. Even when the speaking fees increased well into five figures, he would quietly sign the money over to a hospital or a charity. Sometimes he simply tucked the check into his jacket, where it would be forgotten until the garment was sent to the dry cleaners."I speak at a lot of banquets in small towns, because small towns have so many great people," Hayes said during those boilerplate speeches. "All the presidents came from small towns. The largest town that a president came from was in that state up north," he said, referring to former president Gerald Ford, who hailed from Grand Rapids, Michigan. The standing joke would always bring a chuckle. So deep was his disdain for rival Michigan, that even during these friendly talks Hayes, who counted Ford as a friend, would refuse to mention the state of Michigan by name.Hayes's own tenets were forged in rural Ohio, first in Clifton, a tiny mill town along the banks of the Miami River some seventy-fivemiles southwest of Columbus. It was there that he was born on Valentine's Day in 1913, the third and youngest child of Wayne Benton and Effie Jane Hupp Hayes. Woody was eight years younger than his sister Mary and two years younger than his brother Ike. Unlike his more independent older brother, young Woody was doted upon by both his sister and mother and stayed close to the women in the house."As the youngest, I don't think there was any doubt I was spoiled," Hayes said.In 1915 Wayne Hayes moved his family to nearby Selma, where he took a job as school superintendent, another step in his career as an educator.He was the visionary of the family, an intense man who, with his eleven brothers and sisters, was expected to work the family homestead in Noble County, Ohio. The family had deep Ohio roots. Woody's great grandfather David Hayes was a blacksmith and joined the Union army during the Civil War. He was killed during the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, leaving his father Isaac an orphan at eight years old.Wayne was bright, ambitious, and resourceful, and the family farm wasn't enough to hold him. Most nights after chores and dinner, Wayne's mother would sit him down and school her son in reading and arithmetic, building the foundation for his future for a life off the farm.He saw teaching as a way to better himself. During the early 1900s Ohio was still primarily a rural state, with small, unincorporated towns and hamlets dotting the countryside. High schools in these areas were either distant or absent altogether, so kids who completed the eighth grade could take the Boxwell Examination, that, if successfully completed, could serve as a substitute to a high school diploma. Wayne passed the test, posting a score high enough to qualify him to teach the eighth grade--beginning his long, slow march toward becoming a college graduate and a school superintendent. The Hayes family was serious about education.Achieving high school equivalency by passing the Boxwell Examination was one thing, but attending college was for the wealthy and privileged, not for farm families from Noble County, Ohio. Though married and the father of three young children, Wayne was undeterredby family and financial hurdles that lay before his educational goals. He attended six different colleges at night and during the summers, before eventually earning a degree from Wittenberg College in 1919. Woody was six years old when he saw his father graduate from college. Wayne Hayes was thirty-eight. The memory would stay with Woody forever; his father's perseverance serving to motivate and inspire when things turned dark, as they often did, given Woody's high-octane, combustible personality.The degree brought new opportunities and prosperity to the Hayes household, and in 1920 the family moved northeast to Newcomerstown, Ohio, population 4,500, where Wayne accepted a job as superintendent of schools. It was a sizable step up, compared to the tiny towns like Clifton and Selma where the family previously lived. Wayne earned twenty-eight dollars a month when he first began teaching in the early 1900s. By 1920 he had saved enough money to buy a modest white frame house at 488 East Canal Street, just east of downtown and near a stretch of water that used to be part of the historic Ohio Canal. After spending years working his way across Ohio, Hayes would never move his family again.Woody was seven years old when his father settled his family in this quintessential 1920s small town, nestled in a valley along the Tuscarawas River. Hardworking folks lived in the village bisected by the Ohio Canal; outside the town limits farmland checkered the hilly countryside.It was in essence a company town, with the Clows Pipe Works and the Heller Tool Company serving as the two main employers. The heavy industry, combined with the county's rural population, provided enough economic stimulus to make the town a bustling place. The country's interstate system was still a long way off from crossing through Ohio. Instead, Highway 21 funneled traffic through the heart of the downtown, helping pump commerce into the heart of Main Street. But travel was still difficult, and people who lived in Newcomerstown stayed put. There was a feed store, grocery, clothing store, hardware store, tannery, and even a cigar factory--all located within a few blocks of each other--where the locals spent their money, creating a self-sufficient place where one could buy whatever was needed.Farmers would come into town on Saturday mornings to shop, eat, and perhaps, on summer afternoons, to linger to listen to a local band play uptown on Main Street. The locals would also hold town picnics at Mulvane Park. A summer social highlight was the tricounty fair held in the centrally located town, bringing together residents of Tuscarawas, Coshocton, and Guernsey counties, hoping to have that year's blue-ribbon-winning crops and cattle.The local schoolchildren would swim in the river during the summer and ice skate on it during the winter, and if they collected enough bread wrappers from the local bakery, they could go to the movie house for free. Farmers and other rural folk would gather at the Grange Hall for meetings and dinners. Sunday mornings were for church, and afterwards families either went to a church dinner or to a neighbor's house for meals, dressed in their Sunday best. These get-togethers were formal affairs and provided a way of socializing after a long week of work, but they also helped establish a social pecking order within the town, a town so small that everyone helped each other, but also knew everyone else's business. Whenever a child contracted scarlet fever, the doctor would quarantine the family by placing a large red sign outside the house to serve as a loud warning of the then deadly disease, but also to signal to neighbors to leave food on the front porch of the unfortunate family.There were dozens of towns in the Ohio Valley like Newcomerstown during the early 1900s, but the small village on the river had already made a name for itself, thanks to the baseball heroics of Denton "Cy" Young. Young grew up on a farm outside of town and moved back to his boyhood home after his Hall of Fame baseball career ended in 1911. He managed the local semipro team, sponsored by the Clows Pipp Works, in his retirement, and sometimes he would wear his old Cleveland Indians uniform to remind himself and the locals of his days of fame. The old lefthander would even break out his old Boston uniform on special occasions, like July 4th or Labor Day.Young took a liking to Woody and hired the earnest youngster to do small jobs around the farm, paying him a nickel to groom the local baseball diamond. Cy's fame was not lost on the impressionable Woody. Young would regale him and other locals in farmyard smokehouseswith stories of past stardom, of pitching duels against Walter Johnson, and of other glories that come from winning 511 big league games."That man could make me feel grown up when he said 'Woodrow,' and that's what he always called me," Hayes said. "Here's a man who would sit in front of Denver Reed's smokehouse and talk about pitching, and he pitched for twenty-two years. But he was a humble man. He never made himself look good. Never."It was a time when sports began to enter the collective consciousness of America, with stars like Young, Johnson, Babe Ruth, and Lou Gehrig elevated to hero status. Listening firsthand to Young tell his stories instilled in Hayes an idealistic and virtuous notion of sports, one that would strongly influence the impressionable young man.But it wasn't all ice-cream socials and Main Street bands. Newcomerstown could be a rough-and-tumble place, especially compared to the more prosperous neighboring town of New Philadelphia, the county seat located fifteen miles to the north. Life could get difficult in the seemingly idyllic village. Hard work didn't always pay off and faith wasn't always rewarded, especially when children got sick, or when jobs or farms were lost.And while there may have been a vibrant Main Street, not everyone was welcome. There was a contingent of black residents brought to town to help build the company-owned houses and to work in the foundry that produced cast-iron sewer pipes that were used throughout most of Ohio. The blacks lived on the south end of town, segregated from the whites. Come Saturday night the police invariably would be called to the community house in "Clowstown" to break up knife fights and other violence that sometimes erupted after a backbreaking week of work in the plant.When Wayne Hayes arrived in the summer of 1920, he was greeted with a combination of skepticism and hope that he could breathe new life into the town's school system.From the clapboard house on East Canal Street, a half mile from the main square, the Hayes family settled into their new home--where it didn't take long for the new superintendent to establish himself as a man to be taken seriously.He ran the school district with an iron fist, demanding that histeachers memorize textbooks while doing the same himself. He was a shrewd administrator, hiring promising young teachers just out of college, while weeding out those that weren't adapting to the evolving educational system that was moving the schools to a more modern curriculum. It wasn't long into Wayne's tenure that the teachers began calling their boss "Pappy," or "Pops," as a nod to his dominating management style."When Pappy hired me, I was still a senior at Ohio University, but he needed me to replace another teacher that was run out of town," said Robert "Gene" Riffle, who Wayne had hired to teach industrial arts. "I took the job, but I had to spend all summer building new desks for the students as part of my duties. So, not only did Wayne get a new teacher but he got new desks as well." Rules were to be strictly followed to maintain order and fairness. Right was right and fair was fair, with few exceptions allowed.When neighbor Barbara Scott was to enter the first grade, her mother showed up on the Hayes's front porch with an appeal to allow her daughter to start school with her friends, even though her birthday fell just days past the December cutoff."My mother took me with her to his house to talk to him personally, and he firmly said no," Barbara Scott said. "He said that was the rule, and that was it. He was a very strict and very formal man."Wayne was as strict and demanding at home as he was in the classroom. Self-educated and self-reliant, he expected as much from his children as he did from himself, and he took a formal approach toward his family, signing letters sent to his daughter Mary, away at school, "your father W B. Hayes." He insisted that his children be a cut above the rest in their class, and he pushed them to achieve so much so that Woody once said, "I believe there is nothing tougher than being the school's superintendent's son."But the demands were countered with a strong sense of fairness and respect. Truant officers would be dissuaded to visit the home of a family whose son or daughter was out of school. Wayne would pay the visit instead, sparing the family the embarrassment and shame from nosy neighbors.There wasn't a lot of frivolity and waste in the Hayes household.Work and sacrifice were expected to extend Wayne's small-town-school salary. The family paid cash for most everything. If there was an account balance at one of the local stores it was to be paid off promptly, with no debts to mark a man of standing in the community.Education was honored as much as hard work, and religious teaching and much of the learning took place inside the house on Canal Street. Books filled shelves all over the house, and Wayne would often read aloud to his family, reciting poetry and Latin, trying to instill in his children the importance of academics and culture.He was reaching the pinnacle of his career and commanding a nearly reverent status. Running the school system was considered a professorial life in rural Ohio, and he fit the part. He was a popular speaker throughout the county, espousing his views with a flair for the language, yet maintaining the respect of the community.Wayne brought home the money, but it was his wife who expertly managed it. Effie was from a large rural Ohio farm family, and with nine brothers and sisters she learned at an early age the importance of marshaling a family's resources to make ends meet.When her husband announced to the family that he would not attend his college graduation because of the ten-dollar cap-and-gown fee, Effie dipped into a secret stash she kept in a pitcher on the kitchen sideboard and insisted that the whole family attend.She was a proud, practical, and hardworking woman, but she also provided a sense of balance in the household, a sorely needed quality, given the high level of intensity swirling about her husband.While Wayne Hayes was well built and a good athlete, with fine features and a tough, no-nonense approach, Effie was a large woman who was a steadying influence on her children. She would insist that her family spend Sunday afternoons at the dinner table that was set with linen, and that the kids be dressed in their Sunday best. Around the table, the family talked about sports, world affairs, and philosophies. They gossiped about the goings-on in town, and they talked politics, instilling in Woody his rock-steady Republican beliefs.It didn't take long for the Hayes family to rise to the top of the local social circles, given Wayne's commitment to education, Effie'sinvolvement in various social activities, and their children's burgeoning academ...</p><h2>Children and Fish Don&#39;t Talk, Adventures With Nazis, Communists, and the Metropolitan Opera</h2><p>In the winter of 1964, three weeks after defecting from Poland and the night after playing a flashy holiday performance with the Rockettes at Radio City, Leshek Zavistovski was arrested and faced deportation to a gulag. His troubles started, however, long before he was a fugitive cellist behind bars. As a four-year-old child he was abandoned in a remote Polish village, kidnapped, and swept into the advancing Red Army.

Filled with the thrilling never-before-told personal stories of the prisoners of war held within it's walls -- who made it their personal duty and obsession to escape -- <em>Colditz</em> offers endlessly intriguing stories of consummate survivors who proved the human spirit to be indomitable. </p><p>During World War II Colditz, a medieval fortress, served as the only high-security camp in Germany. Its massive walls contained every persistent escapee, troublemaker, and valuable hostage captured by the Germans. Guards and prisoners were almost equal in number, and Colditz -- which boasted such prison-break deterrents as walls up to twelve feet thick, battlements of solid rock, and a 150-foot drop from the castle to the valley below -- was considered escape proof. But the prisoners -- many of whom were high-ranking military officers -- were determined to accomplish the impossible and pooled their collective talents to create the greatest escape academy of the war. Three hundred officers attempted to escape and thirty achieved what they considered to be the <em>home run,</em> journeying all the way back to their native country.</p><p>In <em>Colditz,</em> Henry Chancellor breaks new ground by offering the prisoners' own stories of the great escapes. Using more than fifty original interviews, the English, French, Dutch, and Polish officers and their guards describe in their own words their experiences in the notorious castle. They reveal their boredom and frustrations, as well as the challenges inherent in making maps out of jelly or constructing tunnels with mere cutlery knives. The stories are by turns comic and tragic as much of their labor and invention ended in failure, but what emerges is a story of breathtaking ingenuity and daring, and an intriguing portrait of the fascinating game of wits between captives and captors, who were bound together by mutual respect and extraordinary tolerance.</p></p><p><i>Colditz</i>, based on author Henry Chancellor's television documentary series, tells the story of the German high security prison camp (a 700-room castle), which during World War II housed the most dangerous (i.e. escape-prone) Allied POWs. The men, officers all, were mandated by the Geneva Convention to escape. There were, over the course of the war, 310 such attempts, 32 of them successful. <i>Colditz</i> is a comprehensive overview. While not neglecting daily prison existence (a world replete with boredom, privation, and occasional acts of treachery), it is strongest recounting the prisoners' many efforts to outwit their captors, occasions of astonishing energy and guile. The prisoners not only dug, climbed, and vaulted their way to freedom, but concocted elaborate disguises, false documents, and on one occasion built a working glider. Chancellor's is an accessible, reliable tale of invention, bravery, and determination. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i><p>Henry Chancellor was born in London in 1968. He grew up in East Anglia and went to Trinity College, Cambridge. <em>Colditz</em> grew out of his remarkable British television series, <em>Escape from Colditz,</em>was twelve years in the making and has won sweeping critical praise and has been shown all over the world. His other documentaries for television include <em>The Great Belzoni,</em> <em>Pirates,</em> and <em>Millennium</em>. He lives in Suffolk with his wife and two sons. </p></p><h2>Civics Flash Cards for the Naturalization Test 2012 (English Version)</h2><p>Study Materials for the Naturalization Test During your naturalization eligibility interview, a USCIS officer will test your ability to read, write, and speak English.

MacCarthy casts a fresh eye on Byron&#39;s childhood in Scotland, his embattled relations with his mother and his series of relationships with adolescent boys.</p><p>Fiona MacCarthy was the Royal Society of Arts Bicentenary Medallist for 1986. She is an honorary fellow both of the Royal College of Art and of the Nineteenth Century Studies Centre at the University of Sheffield. Her controversial life of Eric Gill, published in 1989, established her immediately as an authoritative, serious yet eminently readable biographer, and her William Morris won the Wolfson History Prize and the Writers&#39; Guild Non-fiction Award for 1995.<b>Introduction</b>&nbsp; <p>One of the sights of Europe in 1816 was the lurching progress of the self-exiled Lord Byron as he travelled from Brussels to Geneva and on to Italy in his monumental black Napoleonic carriage. This purpose-built coach, a de luxe version of the Emperor Napoleon's own celebrated carriage captured at Genappe, included not only Byron's <i>lit de repos</i> but his travelling library, his plate-chest and facilities for dining. Drawn by four or six horses, it was nothing less than a small palatial residence on wheels. The hill from Baxter the coach-maker amounted to �500. Poor Baxter was still pressing for payment in 1823, a claim dismissed airily by Byron with the words, 'Baxter must wait -- at least a year.' Presumably the bill was still unsettled when Byron died in Greece in April 1824. &nbsp; The long shadow of Napoleon loomed over Byron's life, an inspiration and an irritant. Byron, born in 1788, the year before the outbreak of the French Revolution, was conscious of living at an unprecedented period: as he put it, 'we live in gigantic and exaggerated times, which make all under Gog and Magog appear pigwean.' The apparition of Napoleon, almost twenty years his senior, was the spur to Byron's own ambition, his dissidence, the glamour of his arrogance, the sense of sweeping history that permeates his writing. Napoleon's flamboyance, his stamina, his dress, his stance, the assiduity with which he preened his image, nurtured Byron's own creative strain of mockery. As he told his friend Lady Blessington, 'with me there is, as Napoleon said, but one step between the sublime and the ridiculous.' </p><p>Byron was bound to Napoleon by ties as strong, or even stronger, than those of any of his sexual liaisons. He found fault with Napoleon, so the sharp-eyed Lady Blessington observed, only 'as a lover does with the trifling faults of his mistress'. His emotional involvement was already strong at Harrow in 1803 when the fierce schoolboy defended his bust of Napoleon, by then the official enemy of England, against the 'rascally time-servers' among his contemporaries. A few years later he had acquired a fine impression of Morghen's engraved portrait of Napoleon, which he sent to be framed resplendently in gilt.&nbsp; </p><p>His personal identification with the Emperor was such that Napoleon's defeats brought on a physical reaction. After Leipzig in 1813 Byron was prostrate with despair and indigestion, groaning in his journal: 'Oh my head! -- how it aches! -- the horrors of digestion! I wonder how Buonaparte's dinner agrees with him? 'In the following year, after Napoleon's abdication and exile to Elba, Byron recorded: 'To-day I have boxed one hour -- written an ode to Napoleon Buonaparte -- copied it -- eaten six biscuits -- drunk four bottles of soda water -- redde away the rest of my time.' That ode was both lament and reproach, for Byron could not approve the abject self-surrender of the hero who should rightly have died on his own sword like a defeated Roman or expired as defianty as Shakespeare's Macbeth or Richard III. But Napoleon still dazzled him, in spite of the anguish of his disillusionment. For Byron, Napoleon was a kind of second nature, part of his thought processes, peculiarly embedded in the detail of his life.&nbsp; </p><p>After Napoleon's final demise Byron accumulated keepsakes: a lock of his hair, snuffboxes with his portrait, gold coins with the depiction of the Emperor that was. There was also the Napoleon cameo pin Byron gave to Lady Blessington in Genoa, removing it with a flourish from his breast, but reclaiming it the next day with the dubious excuse that 'memorials with a <i>point</i>' would bring bad luck. Before he left England in 1816, at the time of the separation scandal, Byron had reserved Napoleon's coronation robes, by then in the hands of a Piccadilly dealer, but never actually claimed them. He did, however, write a fond farewell letter to Mercer Elphinstone, shortly before he sailed, on writing paper pillaged from the imperial bureau at Malmaison and stamped with the Napoleonic eagle: he enclosed a few spare sheets as a parting present. Byron was apparently ecstatic when the death of his mother-in-law Lady Noel allowed him to sign himself NB 'because' (he told Leigh Hunt, admittedly a malicious witness) 'Bonaparte and I are the only public persons whose initials are the same'.&nbsp; </p><p>Byron's wanderings through Italy, from 1816 to 1823, were permeated with memories of Napoleon. He noted, near Milan, the remains of an unfinished triumphal arch, intended for Napoleon, 'so beautiful as to make one regret its non-completion', and on Isola Bella he discovered the large laurel tree on which Napoleon had carved out with his knife the word 'Battaglia' shortly before the battle of Marengo. Byron, himself no mean defacer of trees, had scrutinised the letters closely, by this time 'half worn out and partly erased'.&nbsp; In the context of Italy, Napoleon seemed to Byron more than ever a Vesuvius, a powerful eruptive force whose final overthrow had let in the political light-weights throughout Europe: 'Since that period, we have been the slaves of fools.' There is no doubt that he saw his own incursions into European politics, first as a partisan of the Italian Risorgimento and then in the Greek War of Independence, with whatever undertones of irony, in quasi-Napoleonic terms.&nbsp; </p><p>Copyright � 2002 Fiona MacCarthy</p></p><h2>Hugs for Friends: Stories, Sayings, and Scriptures to Encourage and Inspire (Hugs Series)</h2><p>Stories, Sayings, and Scriptures to Encourage and Inspire</p><p><b>LeAnn Weiss</b>, as a college student, accepted her pastor's challenge to reexamine the Bible as God's personal love letter and source of encouragement.

Shortly after her death in 2009, the first group of her unseen photographs--gritty with humanity and filled with empathy and beauty--were shown online. What followed was a firestorm of attention, catapulting Maier from previous obscurity to being labeled as one of the masters of street photography.

Her never-before-seen work was discovered after the contents of her storage lockers were auctioned off because she couldn&#x2019;t pay the bills. Now the brilliant and intrepid photo reclamation and writing team of Cahan and Williams (The Lost Panoramas, 2011) tell Maier&#x2019;s deeply moving story. They conferred with everyone they could find who knew Maier and chose 300 galvanizing photographs&#x2014;most unprinted, many undeveloped&#x2014;from the tens of thousands she shot. We learn that Maier, of French and Austrian descent, was born in New York City in 1926, raised in the French Alps, traveled the world with her camera, and settled in a Chicago suburb in 1956. She lived frugally while working as a nanny and caregiver, continually taking pictures of her young charges and their world and of Chicago&#x2019;s see-it-all streets, composing urban tableaus of penetrating wit and empathy. Maier was &#x201c;painfully private,&#x201d; outspoken, unconventional, gutsy, and compassionate, and her long-secret photographs evince a profound clarity of vision and intent. Cahan and Williams compare Maier to Emily Dickinson, and her life and work do speak to our most cherished sense of what art is and why it matters. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Cube Route</h2><p><br>For nearly three decades, Piers Anthony's bestselling Xanth series has been delighting tens of thousands of fantasy fans around the world.

What a complicated route, from such a minor trigger. <br>She was out picking bubble gum from the bubble gum tree beyond the hay field when there was a swirl of smoke beside her. "What are you doing?" the smoke inquired. <br>Startled, Cube gazed at it. "Talking smoke?" <br>"That doesn't exactly answer my incertitude," the smoke said, forming a set of eyes. <br>"Your what?" <br>"Dubiousness, skepticism, suspicion, mistrust, uncertainty--" <br>"Question?" <br>"Whatever," the smoke agreed crossly. <br>"I don't see why I should answer you if I can't see you," Cube said. "Are you a refugee from the smoking section?" <br>The smoke formed a mouth. "Ha. Ha. Ha," it said. "Very funny. Not. Don't you recognize a lovely demoness when you see one?" <br>"A demon!" Cube sidled nervously away from the smoke. "I never did anything to you. Why are you harassing me?" <br>"Because that's what demons do." A head formed around the eyes and mouth, framed by smoky hair. "Demoness Metria, not at your ritual." <br>"Not at my what?" <br>"Observance, rite, liturgy, ceremony--" <br>"Service?" <br>"Whatever! So who are you?" <br>"I'm called Cube." <br>"Cube! What kind of a stupid name is that?" <br>"It's not my name." <br>The hair spread out and formed a question mark. "You just said it was." <br>"I said I was called that. I didn't say it was my name." <br>The smoky features swirled a moment, then coalesced back into the face, which was now pretty in a dusky way. "Score one for you, drab mortal. So what <i>is</i> your name?" <br>"Cue. But when other kids saw me, they nicknamed me Cube, because I'm just not with it. I tried to pry it off, but that nickname stuck fast." <br>"They do," Metria agreed. "That's part of the curse of being human. Now answer my first question and I'll give you something." <br>Cube decided that she should do that, before the demoness got angry and did her some harm. "I was just picking bubble gum for the boys." <br>"What use have you for boys?" the demoness asked. <br>"I like them. But they don't like me." <br>The smoke formed a vaguely human female body below the head. "Of course they don't! Look at you." <br>"No thanks. I know I'm not pretty." <br>"That's the understatement of the hour. You give plain a bad name. Whatever made you suppose that any boy anywhere would ever be interested in you?" <br>"Well, I do have a certain quality of character." <br>"Like what?" <br>"Gumption." <br>"What?" <br>"Initiative, courage, aggressiveness, resourcefulness, common sense--" <br>"Guts?" <br>"Whatever," Cube agreed, frowning. "I've got gumption galore, but that doesn't seem to be what boys want." <br>"Naturally not. Boys can see, not think. They don't much notice character." <br>"So I have learned. But I thought that maybe if I got them something nice, like fresh bubble gum, they might let me hang around, and maybe get to know me." <br>"Not without a better appearance. Look at this." A dusky hand extended toward her, holding something. "Use the mirror. It is my promised gift." <br>Cube took the mirror and held it up before her. But it did not show her homely face. It showed an unsightly posterior in a dull skirt. "It's not working." <br>"Yes it is. It's a rear-view mirror." <br>"Rear-view mirror?" <br>"It shows your rear, idiot." <br>"Ugh! That's worse than my face. Take it back." She pushed the mirror toward the demoness. <br>"Nuh-uh! That gift can only be given, not taken back." <br>"I don't regard it as a gift. I don't want it." <br>But the smoke was fading, and in half a moment it was gone. She was stuck with the mirror. <br>She set it on the ground and turned away. And found it back in her hand. She threw it at the trunk of the gum tree, but it returned to her hand before striking the tree. She tried to smash it against a stone, but it shied away. <br>"!!!!" she swore, absolutely disgusted. At age twenty she was old enough to use an ugly word if so motivated. The demoness had succeeded in making a dull day into a bad one. That must have been why D. Metria had bugged her in the first place: to get her to accept the mirror. <br>She looked at the next tree, which bore pretty colored gum drops. She was half tempted to eat some of those, but they would just make her teeth drop out of her gums. That would make it difficult to chew. <br>She jammed the mirror into a pocket and headed for home, disgruntled. Maybe she could find someone else to give it to, someone with a prettier rear than her own. <br>That reminded her of her condition. "I wish I were beautiful!" she exclaimed. "Then I could nab a good man and settle down and have a nice family. Or something." <br>The demoness reappeared. It seemed she hadn't gone far when she faded out. "Ha. Ha. Ha!" she laughed in a carefully measured cadence. <br>"What's so funny?" <br>"You think pulchritude would solve your dreary life?" <br>"What?" <br>"Beauty," the demoness said crossly. "Whatever." <br>"Do you have a problem with vocabulary?" <br>"However did you guess?" <br>"Sometimes I get lucky, if the subject isn't men." <br>"Answer the question." <br>"Yes, beauty would transform my existence. Pretty girls have great lives, even if they have no perceptible minds. Everybody knows that." <br>Metria's form firmed into sheer loveliness. "Like this?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>"Yes!" <br>"You're wrong." <br>"How would you know? You're a demoness. You can assume any form you wish. You can stun any village lout with your beauty." <br>At that point a village lout appeared, walking down the path toward the gum trees. Metria turned toward him, opened her blouse, and inhaled. The lout fell stunned, blindly smirking at the sky. "True. But who wants a lout?" <br>"You could do it to a good man too." <br>"Yes. I did. I'm married." <br>"So you see. That's what I want to do. Then I'd be happy." <br>"Maybe. Lovely women traditionally make poor choices in men." <br>"I wouldn't. I'd choose a good one to stun. Because I have as much character as I don't have body." Then reality crashed in on her. "But what's the use? I'll never be beautiful, so I'll never nab a man." <br>"If that's what you want, why don't you do something about it?" <br>"What <i>can</i> I do about it?" Cube demanded. "I am the way I am." <br>"You can go see the Good Magician Humfrey, dummy, and ask him how to get beautiful." <br>Cube stood still for a good three quarters of a moment. "I never thought of that!" <br>"That's why you're a dummy." <br>Cube realized that in time, without a whole lot of effort, she could get annoyed at the demoness. But it was a good idea. "I'll do it." <br>"Of course he'll charge you a year's service, or the equivalent." <br>"I know that," Cube said, annoyed. <br>"And his Answer will be confusing, so you won't properly understand it until it's too late." <br>"I know that too. But his answers are always true." <br>"Also obvious in retrospect, making you feel even more like a dummy." The demoness faded out again. <br>It was true. But what other choice did she have? If there was any barely possible, remotely conceivable, faintest shadow of an obscure hint of half a chance that she could become even marginally pretty if you liked that type, she had to try for it. What was gumption for, if not to do something brave and foolish? Thus was her decision made. <br>"Ha. Ha. Ha," the voice of the demoness came, with just a wisp of swirling smoke. <br>Cube frowned. She hadn't even voiced her decision, but the infernal demoness knew. Still, she felt buoyed, because now at last she was setting out to do something about her plight. Even if the Good Magician couldn't tell her how to become beautiful, she would know she had done her best. <br>And if, just maybe, somehow, there was a way--what a change that would make in her life! <br>"That's what yooo think," the singsong voice of the demoness came. <br>"Oh, go soak your face." <br>"If you insist." There was a sound of sloshing water. "Glub. Glub. Glub." <br>Cube had to smile. Metria was some character. <br>"Thank you." <br>Cube ignored her. The demoness had to be guessing at her thoughts. <br>"No, your smile gave you away." <br>Oh. <br>The demoness reappeared, evidently about to speak some other incidental mischief. Her feet touched the ground. <br>"Hay!" <br>Metria jumped and puffed into smoke. "Who called?" <br>Cube laughed. "You touched the hay field. It always gets your attention, the first time." <br>"Bother!" the demoness said crossly, and faded. Cube was glad to have seen her get fouled up, for once, instead of doing the fouling. <br>"At least you didn't land on the romants hill," Cube said to the space Metria had faded from. <br>Sure enough, there was a response. "What kind of hill?" <br>"Romants. When the ants bite you, you fall in love. I think there's a small love spring under the hill." <br>"That's novel." <br>"A romants novel?" Cube could take or leave puns, but this did seem to be a good occasion for one. <br>"I'm gone." And maybe this time she was. <br>So when should she make the trek to the Good Magician's castle? Well, there was no time like the present. It wasn't as if she had anything worth returning home for. She lived alone, without even hope of male company. <br>She headed for the nearest enchanted path. Those paths were always best for traveling, because dragons and other noxious beasts couldn't get on them, and they had regular rest stops with pie trees and shelter. In fact she had always wanted to travel, but never had a reason to do it. Now she had the best one: her future happiness. <br>Cube walked swiftly. She was a good walker, having muscles in her legs and stamina in her torso. Of course that was part of the problem; she had muscles instead of feminine curves. So she could out-walk any girl she knew, but of course they didn't need to walk. Men came walking to <i>them</i>. <br>Soon she was out of familiar territory, but she wasn't concerned. She could defend herself if she needed to. Which was another part of the problem: her talent was an ugly, aggressive one, befitting her character, when she would have preferred an appealing, feminine one. <br>She approached a huge mound. It looked like an ant hill, except that wate...</p><h2>Nobody Likes A Cockblock</h2><p>Nobody Likes A Cockblock is a full color paperback children&#39;s book for adults about woodland creature moms and dads just trying to get their swerve on.

The latest in a line of royal falcons with the ability to discern true kings and queens, Craig-Vyvyan sniffs the air, sizes up the bewildered heir to the throne, and refuses to budge. The falcon knows he isn't king-material, and so does the falconer, and so, in his heart of heart's, does the Prince of Wales. From this promising opening, Helprin spins a tale that ricochets in tone between the silliness of <i>The Naked Gun</i> movies and the gravity of a Wesleyan sermon. To prove their worth and prepare them to rule, the Prince and Princess of Wales--loose caricatures of Charles and Diana--are parachuted naked into New Jersey by night and ordered to reconquer America for Britain. <p> Helprin's theme is nobility--acquired, as well as innate. He puts the spoiled but well-meaning Prince and Princess through a series of farcical trials before they reach the startling conclusion that clean living, hard work, and humility will bring out the best in them. The "funny" parts of <i>Freddy and Fredericka</i> would have benefited from vigorous pruning--the book itself is too long--but there are stirring passages on love and duty sprinkled among the gags and loopy names, and some spectacular landscape descriptions--covert portraits of the force that drives the green fuse through the flower and gives the House of Windsor its curious destiny. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>"With a pitch-perfect sense of the absurd . . . he has produced a delightful romp of a book."<br> &#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "<i>Freddy and Fredericka</i> recalls American journeys of self-discovery by Mark Twain, John Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac. . . .

Consumed with grief, Gordianus arrives in the city in the midst of a raging civil war, hoping to discover what happened to his son. But when he witnesses the fall of a young woman from a precipice called Sacrifice Rock, he becomes entangled in discovering the truth&#x2014;did she fall or was she pushed? And where, in all of this, could it be connected to his missing son? Drawn into the city's treacherous depths, where nothing and no one are what they seem, Gordianus must summon all of his skills to discover his son's fate&#x2014;and to safeguard his own life. <br></p><p>In this mystery set in Marseilles in 49 B.C., master detective Gordianus the Finder is on a personal quest to learn the truth about his missing son, Meto. Plunged into the midst of the bloody Roman civil war, the well-connected Gordianus and his son-in-law Davus survive adventure after adventure as they penetrate the Gaulic city Massilia, which is walled against Roman invasion. From the first pages, author Steven Saylor is on sure ground with his distinguished protagonist. Gordianus's careful, thoughtful musings are infused with real pathos as he seeks out information about the lost adoptive son whom, he has been informed, is dead. There is some speculation that Meto betrayed Caesar and that death was his punishment. Lacking a corpse, Gordianus cannot bring himself to believe that Meto is really dead.<p> Indeed, bonds between fathers and children--their betrayals, promises, and legacies--play a key role in the twisting plot of <i>Last Seen in Massilia</i>. Literally the title refers to Meto, but the motif extends to other key characters as well. Apollonides, the imperious ruler of Massilia, has a peculiar bond with his horribly deformed daughter. And the city's "scapegoat" Hieronymus lives out the legacy of his parents' illegal double suicide by being the human repositor of Massilia's collective sins. He is expected to hurl himself from Sacrifice Rock to appease vengeful gods.</p><p> Sacrifice Rock is central to the book, the site of a tussle between man and woman that ends, provocatively, in the woman's death. Was it suicide or murder? The three witnesses--Gordianus, Davus, and Hieronymus--are sharply divided on exactly what they saw. Gordianus pursues the truth of this mystery almost as a diversion from the more compelling mystery of his son's weird disappearance.</p><p> Fans of Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series, of which <i>Last Seen in Massilia</i> is the eighth installment, will be pleased by the author's consistent tone. Saylor has proven that he knows how to season a good plot with lively historical details, and this book is perhaps even more gratifying than previous installments. <i>--Kathi Inman Berens</i></p>Steven Saylor is the author of eight books in the Roma Sub Rosa series featuring Gordianus the Finder.

The religious and institutional shape of modern Tibet was decided in the turbulent conflicts and dramatic reorganization of Tibetan society in the seventeenth century. With Mongol support, the Fifth Dalai Lama took control of Central Tibet and projected Gelukpa power far beyond Lhasa. As is often seen in the writing of history, the victor exerts its authority in its telling. Thus the preceding ruling polity and its leading lama, the Tenth Karmapa, have often been neglected. Ch�ying Dorj�&#39;s life is well documented in Tibetan sources which provide an alternative historical narrative of the tumultuous seventeenth century. This publication brings together specialists in literature, history, religion, and art to discuss the historical context of this seminal Tibetan figure, situating him and his life&#39;s work within the juncture of history, art and civilization, and Tibet&#39;s place in the larger world of the seventeenth century.</p><p></p><h2>Memory of Fire: Vol 1-Genesis</h2><p>A re-creation of the conquest of the Americas and Latin America, divided into 2 parts.

Seeing her history and her most intimate self in this library, she embarks on a search for the bookmobile. Over time her search turns into an obsession.</p><p>Audrey Niffenegger is a visual artist and writer who lives mostly in Chicago and occasionally in London. She has published six books, including the novels The Time Traveler&#39;s Wife and Her Fearful Symmetry. She helped to found the Columbia College Chicago Center for Book and Paper Arts. Her art has been exhibited by Printworks Gallery in Chicago since 1986. She is a Professor in the Fiction Department of Columbia College. Her recent projects include a ballet, Raven Girl, in collaboration with Wayne McGregor for the Royal Opera House Ballet.*Starred Review* Niffenegger&#x2019;s love for and wariness about libraries is threaded through her best-selling first novel, The Time Traveler&#x2019;s Wife (2003), and blossoms poisonously in her first graphic novella. An artist given to elegantly eerie and clever drawings, as seen in her two illustrated novels, Niffenegger makes supple use of the graphic format in this pensive and unnerving story. Alexandra is out walking late one night on a quiet Chicago street after a fight with her boyfriend when she happens upon an old Winnebago that turns out to be a magical mystery bookmobile open between &#x201c;dusk and dawn,&#x201d; and piloted by Robert, a gentleman librarian who serves tea. Even more strangely, its collection comprises every book Alexandra has ever read. She is galvanized. She looks for the bookmobile every night and longs to work with Robert. Years go by. Alexandra reads incessantly and becomes a librarian. Yet still she is refused a place on the bookmobile, until one especially grim night. With beautifully complex perspectives, lustrous and moody colors, and refined expressiveness, Niffenegger has created a haunting cautionary tale about solitude, obsession, and the unfathomable power of books. Originally serialized in the Guardian in England, this is the first provocative volume in a larger work titled The Library. While the book is best suited for adult collections, teens who like classy and psychologically subtle spooky tales will shiver happily over this gorgeous short story as well. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Drawing Sharp Focus Still Lifes</h2><p>Demonstrates special techniques for creating realistic sketches of landscapes and still lifes and includes advice on drawing materials</p><p></p><h2>Grandmother Winter</h2><p>All through the spring, summer and fall, Grandmother Winter tends her geese and gathers their feathers.

The prose gently foreshadows the closing spreads; in summer, for instance, Grandmother Winter gathers the goose feathers, "soft as snowflakes,/ bright as a winter moon."

Pyne is a professor at Arizona State University. The author of ten acclaimed books on environmental history, he won the 1995 <i>Los Angeles Times's</i> Robert Kirsch Award for his career contribution to arts and letters.Following last summer's wildfires and debate over "controlled burning," Pyne, author of the five-volume Cycle of Fire and the much-acclaimed How the Canyon Became Grand, has become one of the most widely consulted experts on American fire policy. While this book's focus is on fires that raged 91 years ago in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, it addresses such perennial questions as whether there can be a "good" forest fire and the place of fire in healthy forest ecology. Fighting the 1910 Great Fires ignited variously by lightning, abandoned campfires and "candle-sized flames sparked by railroads" cost many lives and injured hundreds. An continuing program of human-controlled "light burning" might have been better, but infighting in scientific forestry circles (compounded by political and bureaucratic sniping) silenced this minority position. Teddy Roosevelt was "bully" on conservation and his five-year-old Forest Service was devoutly antifire. Fire wasn't seen as a natural part of the forest's life cycle it was the enemy and it had to be stopped, no matter how many lives it cost. Pyne builds his case with a dense, month-by-month chronology. At his best with a hard-luck or disaster story, he overwrites his polemic sections shamelessly, occasionally lapsing into awkward similes (firefighters crowded into a cave like "oats in a feedbag"). Maps make the fire's geography easier to follow, while the photo inset gives a period flavor to the tale. (May 7)Forecast: A sharp dust jacket and an author tour in the West, combined with Pyne's eminence in his field, will draw attention to this book, but his generally lifeless prose won't spark major sales.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Horray for Fly Guy!</h2><p>Children will laugh out loud at the story and pictures in this sixth book in the easy-to-read Fly Guy series! &#34;Flies can&#39;t play football,&#34; says the coach.

This is the story of the nightmare at the heart of her yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment.<br></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, April 2000:</b> Originally published in 1970, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> is Toni Morrison's first novel. In an afterword written more than two decades later, the author expressed her dissatisfaction with the book's language and structure: "It required a sophistication unavailable to me." Perhaps we can chalk up this verdict to modesty, or to the Nobel laureate's impossibly high standards of quality control. In any case, her debut is nothing if not sophisticated, in terms of both narrative ingenuity and rhetorical sweep. It also shows the young author drawing a bead on the subjects that would dominate much of her career: racial hatred, historical memory, and the dazzling or degrading power of language itself. <p> Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> is something of an ensemble piece. The point of view is passed like a baton from one character to the next, with Morrison's own voice functioning as a kind of gold standard throughout. The focus, though, is on an 11-year-old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, whose entire family has been given a cosmetic cross to bear: </p><blockquote> You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.... And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it. </blockquote> There are far uglier things in the world than, well, ugliness, and poor Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's spat upon, ridiculed, and ultimately raped and impregnated by her own father. No wonder she yearns to be the very opposite of what she is--yearns, in other words, to be a white child, possessed of the blondest hair and the bluest eye. <p> This vein of self-hatred is exactly what keeps Morrison's novel from devolving into a cut-and-dried scenario of victimization. She may in fact pin <i>too</i> much of the blame on the beauty myth: "Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion." Yet the destructive power of these ideas is essentially colorblind, which gives <i>The Bluest Eye</i> the sort of universal reach that Morrison's imitators can only dream of. And that, combined with the novel's modulated pathos and musical, fine-grained language, makes for not merely a sophisticated debut but a permanent one. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"This story commands attention, for it contains one black girl's universe."<br>--Newsweek <p>"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye is an inquiry into the reasons why beauty gets wasted in this country. The beauty in this case is black.

Photographer Frederic Brenner goes beyond the confines of conventional Judaism to depict the practical application of the religion in everyday America. A visual catalogue of signs, ritual objects, artifacts, and kitsch rounds out this book.French photographer Brenner spent two years criss-crossing the U.S. to produce this freewheeling, provocative and intriguing portrait of Jewish-American life, from Alaska fur traders to a Miami Beach auto shop owner and Persian immigrants in New Jersey. Imaginative and sometimes artfully posed, his 801 photos often express mordant irony or cultural juxtapositions: a Passover seder, with its emphasis on freedom from bondage in a maximum-security women's prison; Soviet-Asian cab drivers in Coney Island; a chorus line of glamorously dressed Broadway stars at a sukkah feast on a skyscraper roof overlooking the Empire State Building. Brenner exuberantly narrates or reenacts real-life dramas, as in his group portrait of a sheriff and citizens of Billings, Mont., who showed solidarity with a Jewish family whose house had been vandalized. His celebrity portraits of Steven Spielberg, Betty Friedan, Jerry Lewis, Saul Bellow and others subtly ironize the sitters' sense of themselves. Noted cultural historian Schama thoughtfully discusses Brenner as an artist who celebrates the diversity of Jewish- American life and the ambiguous, shifting border between the Jewish and Gentile worlds. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Infinite Bandwidth: Encountering Christ in the Media</h2><p><p>Franciscan University of Steubenville Professor Eugene Gan authors this first-of-its-kind Catholic roadmap for the digital age:<i> Infinite Bandwidth: Encountering Christ in the Media</i>. He navigates you faithfully through the digital world, encouraging frustrated parents not to throw out cell phones, ban the Internet, chuck computers, or pitch portable media devices. That would be a mistake and believe it or not would be going against more than seven decades of Catholic teaching. From Church documents on social communications, Gan extracts seven principles or media keys of how to approach and use media. The Church and Gan say that we must enter into the modern day Areopagus, the social and intellectual hub of ancient Athens where Paul preached to pagans, and use the media tools God has given us to make truth known and serve mankind. Cardinal John Patrick Foley says, Frankly, I wish that such a book had existed when I was president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications as a text which I could have recommended. The important thing, however, is that it exists now to provide a text, context, and challenge for those who wish to bring both Christian principles and professional excellence to their work in the media. </p> <p>Gan offers chapter after chapter of real-life experience of how to assess movies, games, and gadgets for you and your teens. Of how to judge the merits of a film like <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, and what sets it apart from <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>. Can the one be acceptable viewing and the other not? Definitely. And Gan details why. <i>Infinite Bandwidth: Encountering Christ in the Media</i> is way out front of the newest gizmo and will stay there thanks to its timeless principles that can be applied in all digital terrain, now and the future. Parents, educators, and students will put this book down with an entirely different attitude about the relationship between faith and media use.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Eugene Gan s <i>Infinite Bandwidth</i> presents the Catholic Church s documents on communications in a most engaging and interesting manner, comprising seven media keys and a fascinating introduction, Googling with God: A Catholic Approach to Media. </p> <p>Frankly, I wish that such a book had existed when I was president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications as a text which I could have recommended. The important thing, however, is that it exists now to provide a text, context, and challenge for those who wish to bring both Christian principles and professional excellence to their work in the media.</p> <p>In an increasingly secularized environment, in which religion is no longer featured in the general media except in a sensational manner and in which it is so often forced to live in a ghetto, Dr. Gan offers a challenging vision of how, why, and when to use all media in an imaginative, challenging, and faith-filled way.</p> --<b>John Patrick Cardinal Foley</b>, Grand Master, Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem; President Emeritus, Pontifical Council for Social Communications<br><br><p>A very helpful guide to a very important but difficult issue: How do Catholics relate to the media explosion? Eugene Gan offers a thoughtful and constructive analysis, which is sure to illuminate and guide.</p><p><b>Dr. Scott Hahn,</b>Author, Speaker, and Professor of Theology, Franciscan University of Steubenville</p><br><p>Some things take experience. Some things take a dad. And other things take a university professor. And some things must take all three. Eugene Gan has drawn on his experience as a user and creator of all sorts of media, his concerns as a father, and his understanding of the way college students live with their ever-present electronics to create a book that answers questions (and worries) that many Catholics may have had in the back of their minds for a long time.</p><p> I am delighted with what Eugene Gan has done to make the Church's tradition of teaching on the media not just accessible but practical. (If! weren't using my thumbs to type this, I would definitely give "Infinite Bandwidth" two thumbs up.) His book will be especially helpful to Catholics who (like the Church herself) recognize that the culture we live in is formed in great part by the use of communications technologies. Unplugging across the board is not an option the Church recommends. The Church is not afraid of media! She sees them as "marvels" the Lord has put in our hands.</p><p> Gan provides the reader with seven keys to healthy Catholic media use. He drew all seven from official Church documents, synthesizing 70 years of official teaching into a practical guide to living as genuinely Christian citizens of the media culture. His self-evaluation questions are totally on target, addressing not just abuse by excess (unrestrained or uncritical media consumption) but also by defect (limiting oneself to the most unchallenging movies, or failing to create positive media content). Best of all, Gan gives the whole presentation a supernatural grounding by connecting each of the "keys" to healthy media use to a specific virtue.</p><p> I commend Eugene Gan highly for a well-crafted work that am going to refer to often and recommend broadly.</p><p>Gratefully in St. Paul,</p><p><b> Sister Anne Joan Flanagan, FSP,</b>Daughters of St. Paul, a.k.a. "nunblogger"</p><br><p> In the exceptionally well-written and researched "The 7 Media Keys (A Catholic Media Guide)," Eugene Gan presents the reader with a comprehensive Catholic framework to consume and critique contemporary media. He skillfully argues that it is critical for Catholics to engage contemporary culture, using Pope John Paul II�s comparison of today�s new media landscape to the Areopagus - the social and intellectual hub of ancient Athens where Paul preached to pagans.</p><p><b>Dr. Derry Connolly,</b>President of John Paul the Great Catholic University</p><br><p>Engaging and thoughtful as all media should be, Dr. Gan practices what he preaches in his book Infinite Bandwidth. He skillfully summarizes over seventy years of Catholic teaching on the marvels and menace of media and offers an engaging reflection as well as a helpful approach to media use for parents and teachers alike. If you are looking for a Catholic guide in this age of shifting values and the proliferation of the communication tools, <i>Infinite Bandwidth</i> is a tremendous resource.</p><p><b>Father Robert P. Reed,</b>President, The CatholicTV� Network</p> --<b>Father Robert P. Reed,</b>President, The CatholicTV� Network<br><br><p><i>Infinite Bandwidth: Encountering Christ in the Media</i> by Dr. Eugene Gan is a great gift to the Church as we experience a surge of media and social communication. Dr. Gan masterfully pulls together the many Church documents and statements on media through the years. From these documents, Eugene gives us seven media keys to help people properly critique all forms of media. He uses the same keys in helping those who produce media to evaluate what they are creating and how it can best serve the mission of the Church in today's world. Dr. Gan makes it clear that people must not run in fear from the latest technologies and new forms of media, but embrace them with a critical eye and use them well for proclaiming the truth and beauty of our Catholic faith in a more credible manner. Dr. Gan demonstrates the necessary tools to view media with a Catholic mind and heart. His book will change the way you view your next movie, listen to that new song, what games you play on your computer and the apps in your iPhone. If all people of faith follow the seven keys presented by Eugene Gan, they will consume media and media will not consume them.</p><p><b> Father Jay Finelli,</b>the iPadre Catholic Podcast &amp; Videocast</p> --<b>Father Jay Finelli,</b> the iPadre Catholic Podcast &amp; Videocast</p><h2>Reiki: Universal Life Energy (English and German Edition)</h2><p>The first book written on Reiki! This runaway bestseller began the rebirth of interest in Reiki, an ancient energetic healing technique which is transmitted from master to student. It is the favorite of Reiki Masters because of its purity and power. This book gives a history of the Reiki Master lineage through Hawayo Takata, describes how Reiki is used and how one can learn it. This classic has been translated into many languages, spreading Reiki all over the world.</p><p>It has been such an honor to publish this book, which for so long was the only book in print about Reiki. Now the list of books about Reiki is very long-but this book has the great purity of &#34;beginner&#39;s mind&#34; and it is still favorite of many Reiki Masters.While the roots of Reiki reach far back into the ancient origins of natural healing, the method presented here has been rediscovered in modern times and is now well on the way to becoming a widely practiced form of folk medicine. More and more practitioners, therapists and healers are making Reiki part of their therapeutic program, or are practicing this method exclusively; but above all, Reiki is being used by more and more nonprofessionals as a most effective means of promoting health and well being. <p>No one can claim a monopoly on Reiki, because Reiki is described as the energy which forms the basis of all life. With the help of specific methods, anyone can learn to awaken and activate this universal life energy so that healing and harmonizing energy flows through the hands. Reiki is healing energy in the truest sense of the word, leading to greater individual harmony and attunement to the basic forces of the universe. </p><p>The authors describe their experience in treating their patients and also with animals and plants. They give an account of the origin and history of Reiki-independent of the individual schools existing-and explain how Reiki acts, how it can be learned and its various uses, while providing a wealth of useful hints and instructions on the practice of Reiki. Moreover, this book features a unique compilation and interpretation of over 200 psychosomatic symptoms and diseases.</p></p><h2>Folk Photography: The American Real-Photo Postcard, 1905 1930</h2><p>In rural America at the beginning of the twentieth century, the worldwide postcard craze coincided with the spread of light, cheap photographic equipment. The result was the real-photo postcard, so-called because the cards were printed in darkrooms rather than on litho presses, usually in editions of a hundred or fewer, the work of amateurs and professionals alike. They were not intended for tourists, but as a medium of communication for the residents of small towns, isolated on the plains and in the hills. The cards document everything about their time and place, from intimate matters to events that qualified as news. They show people from every walk of life and the whole panorama of human activity: eating, sleeping, labor, worship, animal husbandry, amateur theatrics, barn-raising, spirit-rapping, dissolution, riot, disaster, death. Uncountable millions of them were made in the peak years, 1905 to 1912.<br><br>Previous books on the subject have been content to dwell on the nostalgia value of the images. This book takes a broader and deeper view. The 122 postcards it reproduces cover the vast range of subjects encompassed by the medium sometimes lyrical and sometimes bracingly harsh while Luc Sante&#x2019;s pathbreaking introductory essay places them in their full historical and artistic context.<br><br>Sante argues that the cards were a medium of expression very much like the folk music being made in the same places at the same time open to the complete and unvarnished experience of life, and enacting tradition even as they embody modernity. Besides that, he demonstrates that they represent a crucial stage in the evolution of photography, as the essential link between the plain style of the Civil War photographers and the vision of the great midcentury documentarians, Walker Evans above all.<br><br>Combining his gifts as a chronicler of early twentieth-century America, a historian of photography, and a clear-eyed and eloquent critic, Sante shows how the postcards&#x2019; vast, teeming, borderless body of work&#x201d; add up to a self-portrait of the American nation.&#x201d;</p><p>Luc Sante&#39;s books include Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York, Evidence, The Factory of Facts, and Kill All Your Darlings: Pieces 1990-2005. He is a frequent contributor to the New York Review of Books and has written about books, movies, art, photography, and music for many other periodicals. Sante has received a Whiting Writer&#39;s Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a Grammy (for album notes).

As a girl, Jean Marshall had seemed the epitome of virtue and obedience, qualities demanded by her naval-officer father and status-conscious mother. While a student at Radcliffe in 1939, however, Jean starts to write for a pacifist literary review and begins an erotic relationship that leads to some heady cloak-and-dagger machinations whose astonishing reverberations will be felt 50 years later. Eventually, she marries someone suitable and becomes a full-time mother, drawing disdain from her talented daughter, Diane, who vows her life will never be as dull as Jean's. Diane builds a custom jewelry business, winning world renown, but she incurs the hostility of her own daughter, Julia, who has felt abandoned during crucial times. Julia has her own way of striking back and precipitates a crisis. The story, ever fluid, gracefully incorporates details of 1930s Washington society and insights into the process of jewelry design. Although the characters never become quite lifelike and their dialogue is just a little too glib, a series of well-integrated surprises sustains reader interest. 50,000 first printing; major ad/promo; Literary Guild selection. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Diane, a successful jewelry designer, is flanked on both sides by a mother and daughter whose choices in life she finds hard to understand. Her recently widowed mother, Jean, wanders through Europe alone. Diane's teenage daughter, Julia, is failing in school and would rather become a chef than a college student. What the three women unknowingly share is the experience of early love as a form of madness. It is Jean's long unresolved, daringly rebellious story of early love that contributes to the "family secrets" of the title. When the FBI undertakes an investigation into Jean's involvement with an antiwar movement during the 1940s, Diane is caught up in the search for truth about her mother's past. Similar in theme to Thayer's Three Women at Water's Edge ( LJ 9/15/81), this novel adds a dash of political suspense to the more predictable themes of love, marriage, and intergeneration conflict.

He is a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and lives in New York City.<br>The complex experience of Italy's Jews under fascism is personified in the experiences of five families whose socioeconomic and geographic background and response to fascism varied, but who all were overtaken by the tragedy of the Italian holocaust. From fervent belief in fascism, through courageous resistance to the horrors of Buchenwald and back, the story is told in the words of the families themselves, interwoven with the author's clear and dispassionate historical narrative. This book is thoroughly researched and documented, but it is the distinctive and surprisingly calm voices of the families that provide a harrowing and deeply moving oral history. A worthy companion to such classics of the Italian holocaust as Giorgio Bassani's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (HBJ, 1983) and Primo Levi's The Periodic Table ( LJ 1/85), this should be in all libraries with collections in European history or Jewish studies.

The ground has shifted beneath our feet. We did not feel it. But change has come, just the same.<br><br>We must reacquaint modern Christians with the eschatologically driven preaching and teaching of Edwards. This word &#x201c;eschatological&#x201d; may trip some readers up at first encounter, but it refers simply to &#x201c;last things&#x201d;, things of eternity and ultimate significance. We exhume Edwards' scripturally fired material on the reality of the afterlife, the terror of hell, the glories of heaven, and the shape life must take in light of these realities.<br><br>If we accept the Word as our authority, and if we will allow Edwards to serve as our faithful and imaginative guide, we will find that God is alive. He is Lord of heaven and earth, the sovereign ruler of all Creation. He is not small. He can be found.

Christoph Baumer's ambitious four-volume treatment of the region charts the 3000-year drama of Scythians and Sarmatians; Soviets and transcontinental Silk Roads; trade routes and the transmission of ideas across the steppes; and the breathless and brutal conquests of Alexander the Great and Chinghiz Khan. Masterfully interweaving the stories of individuals and peoples, the author's engaging prose is richly augmented throughout by colour photographs taken on his own travels. For all the complexity of the history, Dr Baumer, a noted authority on Central Asia, never loses sight of the sweeping grandeur of its overall setting. Volume 1 focuses on the geography of the area now occupied by present-day Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, northern Afghanistan, western and central Mongolia and parts of southern Russia and northern China.<br>Discussing the changing climates of the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Ages, the author explores subjects as diverse as glacial retreat; the invention of the wheel; the legendary Cimmerians and Amazons; Hellenism and Zoroastrianism; and the Oxus Treasure. Future volumes will explore the later historical periods of the region.</p></p><p>Christoph Baumer - a leading explorer and historian of Central Asia, Tibet and China - has written several well-received books in the fields of history, religion, archaeology and travel. These include The Church of the East: An Illustrated History of Assyrian Christianity (2006), Traces in the Desert: Journeys of Discovery across Central Asia (2008) and China&#39;s Holy Mountain: An Illustrated Journey into the Heart of Buddhism (2011), all published by I.B.Tauris. Dr Baumer is President of the Society for the Exploration of EurAsia and a member of the Explorer&#39;s Club, New York, and the Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Geographical Society, London.<p>""This, in my judgment, is a most impressive book. Dr. Baumer has a wide-ranging knowledge of his subject, an extensive on-the-ground acquaintance with Central Asia itself, and an ability to convey that knowledge in a most interesting and comprehensible way. He has a gift for the striking observation. For example, he remarks on a curious parallel between a Central Asian story about a hero's sword having to be thrown into the sea and the rather similar tale about Excalibur, commenting that this is perhaps not merely coincidence: might it have something to do with the Sarmatian soldiers sent by Marcus Aurelius to guard Hadrian's Wall? Another excellent idea is the periodic insertion of 'excursuses,' on such topics as Roy Chapman Andrews the 'dinosaur hunter,' the Siberian collections of Peter the Great, and the Amazons. No history of Central Asia, or indeed of anywhere else, can ultimately claim to be 'complete.' But this one is certainly very comprehensive indeed, far more so than any other recent work of which I am aware. The publication of this volume, and of its successors too, seems to me to be a very valuable enterprise indeed."" &#x2013; David Morgan, Professor Emeritus of History, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and author of The Mongols </p></p><h2>Edifices de Rome Moderne (Reprint Series)</h2><p>Paul Letarouilly's masterpiece, <em>Edifices de Rome Moderne,</em> has been hailed as the most beautiful book on Renaissance architecture ever published.

Bush: The American Presidents Series: The 43rd President, 2001-2009</h2><p><p><b>The controversial president whose time in office was defined by the September 11 attacks and the war on terror</b><br><b></b><br>George W. Bush stirred powerful feelings on both sides of the aisle. Republicans viewed him as a resolute leader who guided America through the September 11 attacks and retaliated in Afghanistan and Iraq, while Democrats saw him as an overmatched president who led America into two inconclusive wars that sapped the nation's resources and diminished its stature. When Bush left office amid a growing financial crisis, both parties were eager to move on.</p><p>In this assessment of the nation's forty-third president, James Mann sheds light on why George W. Bush made the decisions that shaped his presidency, what went wrong, and how the internal debates and fissures within his administration played out in such a charged atmosphere. He shows how and why Bush became such a polarizing figure in both domestic and foreign affairs, and he examines the origins and enduring impact of Bush's most consequential actions-including Iraq, the tax cuts, and the war on terror. In this way, Mann points the way to a more complete understanding of George W. Bush and his times.</p></p><p><p><b></b><br><b>James Mann</b> is the author of six books on American politics and national security issues, including <i>Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet</i> and <i>The Obamians: The Struggle Inside the White House to Redefine American Power</i>. A longtime correspondent for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, he is currently a fellow in residence at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>Prologue <p></p> <p>During the 2000 presidential campaign, it was frequently said of George W. Bush that he had almost never set foot outside the United States. News articles repeatedly specified that, other than Mexico, he had made only three trips outside the United States in his life: one to China; one to Rome, Israel, and Egypt; and one to Gambia to represent his father&#x2019;s administration. Commentators often rehashed this reporting, taking this skimpy list as evidence of his seeming provinciality and lack of curiosity.</p> <p>Thus, I was quite startled when, in writing a previous book about George W. Bush&#x2019;s foreign-policy team, I ran across a casual remark Bush made in 2003 on the eve of a presidential trip to Britain. The interviewer David Frost asked if this was Bush&#x2019;s first visit to London. "I&#x2019;ve been there a couple of times," Bush answered. "I remember Laura and I went to see &#x2018;Cats&#x2019; in London. Gosh, I remember going to some nice pubs in London." Some further checking turned up the information that Bush had, in fact, made several trips to Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, stopping in London, Scotland, Paris, Spain, and Portugal, among other places, mostly as part of a business group, the Young Presidents&#x2019; Organization. He and his advisers did not bother to correct the news stories in the 2000 campaign; if the impression formed that he was unsophisticated, that was of little concern (and could even help with some voters).</p> <p>That episode provides a fitting introduction to the life of George W. Bush. With Bush, appearances were frequently deceiving. He styled himself as a common man and tough-talking Texan, yet he came from a world of wealth, private schooling, and privilege. He was among the most unpopular of U.S. presidents, reviled by millions of Americans, yet those who met him in person usually found him to be likable and charming. He was caricatured as stupid, an impression furthered by his many malapropisms, yet those who worked with or for him often reported him to be surprisingly canny. Politically, too, impressions of Bush were often misleading: he held himself out as a strong conservative yet, in the end, he angered the political right with big-government programs such as Medicare prescription drug benefits and the TARP program during the financial crisis.</p> <p>He was only the second president in American history whose father had previously held the job, following the path of John Quincy Adams in the early nineteenth century. His relationship with his father, George H. W. Bush, had often been a preoccupying factor in his life. When he was a boy, he was sometimes known as Little George. When he first became involved in politics, helping out in his father&#x2019;s political campaigns, he was called Junior, a name he disliked. Eventually, the nickname that stuck for years was the middle initial that distinguished him from his father: he was "W" (or, in Texas, "Dub-ya").</p> <p>Once, while his father was vice president, he heard someone speak casually about the difficulties of being a "PK," a preacher&#x2019;s kid. "You think that&#x2019;s tough?" asked Bush, who was then nearly forty years old. "Try being a VPK [a vice president&#x2019;s kid]." Soon after his father became president, George W. Bush ordered a campaign adviser to prepare a written report for him on what happened to the children of American presidents. The survey found that while a few went on to successful careers, many others were ne&#x2019;er-do-wells, damaged by the burden of their powerful, successful fathers.</p> <p>The fact that he was a president&#x2019;s son hovered in the background throughout George W. Bush&#x2019;s presidency. It sometimes colored how his policies were perceived and portrayed. When he first came to the White House, his presidency was said to be a "retread" of his father&#x2019;s administration. Later on, after he carried out policies very different from those of his father, the commentary changed: it was said that he must somehow harbor some sort of oedipal resentment.</p> <p>Bush himself showed signs of sensitivity on this subject. "The one somewhat touchy area between us&#x2014;never openly discussed&#x2014;was my close relationship to the president&#x2019;s father," wrote Robert M. Gates, Bush&#x2019;s second defense secretary, who had previously held senior positions in the George H. W. Bush administration. When Gates was first approached about the Pentagon job in late 2006 and was asked to talk with the president, he first consulted quietly with Bush&#x2019;s father. Soon he proceeded to an interview with George W. Bush, who told Gates, wrongly, that his father didn&#x2019;t know the job offer was in the works.</p> <p>Nevertheless, George H. W. Bush turned out to be largely irrelevant to George W. Bush&#x2019;s presidency. The younger Bush confronted a series of problems his father never faced, ranging from the September 11 attacks to Hurricane Katrina to the global financial crisis. And by the time the president left office, his father was an afterthought. George W. Bush became undeniably his own man, launching initiatives and making mistakes that were all his own, arousing passions both positive and negative of the sort that his father never attracted.</p>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022; <p></p> <p>George W. Bush was president at a critical juncture in American history. The attacks of September 11 marked the only time since Pearl Harbor or the War of 1812 that there was a direct foreign attack on American soil. That day brought to an end the sense of calm, security, and triumphalism that had prevailed in the United States following the end of the cold war.</p> <p>America had entered the new millennium at the peak of its power. At home, the U.S. economy had grown rapidly through the 1990s; one of the reigning economic questions at the time Bush took office was what to do about the large surpluses the federal budget was running. On the world stage, America faced no serious rival as a global power.</p> <p>Eight years later, at the end of Bush&#x2019;s term, the United States was struggling to regain its stature abroad and its prosperity at home. The actions Bush took were often (though not always) a contributing factor in the country&#x2019;s reversal of fortune. The question of what might have happened if someone else were president is the sort of counterfactual that can be debated endlessly. There can be no doubt, however, that Bush&#x2019;s presidency marked a troubled entry into the twenty-first century for the United States and a turning point in its self-confident approach to the world. It was, by any standard, one of the most consequential presidencies in American history.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2015 by James Mann</p></p><h2>The Archaeology of Knowledge (World of Man) (English and French Edition)</h2><p>The author discusses the tools used in the field of historical analysis and explores the principles and problems involved in studying the human being</p><p>Madness, sexuality, power, knowledge-are these facts of life or simply parts of speech?

The book claims to provide full theory and practical instructions on alchemy and how to make the real Philosophers&#39; Stone, capable of healing all disease, reversing the aging process and transmuting lead into gold. A bold claim if there ever was one. By the next day, all of us at Forgotten Books had read through the manuscript, which was submitted as a compressed file of WordPad documents. Although opinions differed, we all agreed that The Book of Aquarius is a fascinating and even entertaining read (some of us were laughing out loud at times), certainly a great addition to alchemical literature, not just on Forgotten Books but in the whole realm of English language alchemical literature available. Such an interesting, objective and no-nonsense book on alchemy has never before been written, yet it somehow fits in perfectly with the older alchemical books published centuries ago. The writing style is not what you might expect; modern and informal at times, but at the same time the words have a resonance of truth about them. But the question remains: &#34;is it true?&#34; I can&#39;t say I know the answer. That is for you to decide. The claims are unbelievable, yet the explanations are perfectly logical.

The guest of honor, an actor from the Burgtheater, is late. As the other guests wait impatiently, they are seen through the critical eye of the narrator, who begins a silent but frenzied, sometimes maniacal, and often ambivalent tirade against these former friends, most of whom were brought together by the woman whom they had buried that day. Reflections on Joana's life and suicide are mixed with these denunciations until the famous actor arrives, bringing a culmination to the evening for which the narrator had not even thought to hope.<br><br>"Mr. Bernhard's portrait of a society in dissolution has a Scandinavian darkness reminiscent of Ibsen and Strindberg, but it is filtered through a minimalist prose. . . . <i>Woodcutters</i> offers an unusually intense, engrossing literary experience."&#x2014;Mark Anderson, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Musical, dramatic and set in Vienna, <i>Woodcutters</i>. . . .resembles a Strauss operetta with a libretto by Beckett."&#x2014;Joseph Costes, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Thomas Bernhard, the great pessimist-rhapsodist of German literature . . . never compromises, never makes peace with life. . . . Only in the pure, fierce isolation of his art can he get justice."&#x2014;Michael Feingold, <i>Village Voice</i><br><br>"In typical Bernhardian fashion the narrator is moved by hatred <i>and</i> affection for a society that he believes destroys the very artistic genius it purports to glorify. A superb translation."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> (1931-89) grew up in Salzburg and Vienna, where he studied music. In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother.<i>Being unable to make people more reasonable, I preferred to be happy away from them.</i><br> &#x2014;Voltaire<br><br><i>While</i> everyone was waiting for the actor, who had promised to join the dinner party in the Gentzgasse after the premiere of <i>The Wild Duck</i>, I observed the Auersbergers carefully from the same wing chair I had sat in nearly every day during the fifties, reflecting that it had been a grave mistake to accept their invitation. I had not seen the couple for twenty years, and then, on the very day that our mutual friend <i>Joana</i> had died, I had met them by chance in the <i>Graben,</i> and without further ado I had accepted their invitation to this <i>artistic dinner,</i> as they described the supper they were giving. For twenty years I had not wanted to know anything about the Auersbergers; for twenty years I had not seen the Auersbergers, and in these twenty years the very mention of the name Auersberger had brought on third-degree nausea, I thought, sitting in the wing chair. And now this couple is bringing me face to face once more with the life we led in the fifties. For twenty years I&#x2019;ve avoided the Auersbergers, for twenty years I haven&#x2019;t even met them, and then I have to run into, them in the Graben, I thought. It had been a piece of monumental folly not only to go to the Graben in the first place, but to walk up and down the Graben several times, as I was in the habit of doing, at least since returning to Vienna from London: it was a street where I might have known I would be <i>sure</i> to meet the Auersbergers one day, and not only the Auersbergers, but all the other people I had been avoiding for the last twenty or thirty years, people with whom I had had close ties in the fifties, what the Auersbergers used to call close <i>artistic ties,</i> ties which I had severed a quarter of a century ago, when I got away from the Auersbergers and went to London, <i>breaking</i>, as they say, with all my Viennese acquaintances of that period, not wanting to see them again or have anything more to do with them. Going for a walk in the Graben, I thought as I sat in the wing chair, means nothing more nor less than walking straight into the social hell of Vienna and meeting the very people I have no wish to meet, people whose sudden appearance brings on all kinds of physical and mental strains. Hence in recent years, whenever I came over from London to Vienna, I had chosen different routes for my walks, avoiding not only the Graben, but also the Kohlmarkt and, of course, the K�rntnerstrasse. I had avoided the Spiegelgasse, the Stallburggasse and the Dorotheergasse too, not to mention the dreaded Wollzeile and the Operngasse, where I have so often been trapped by the very people I most detest. But in recent weeks, I reflected as I sat in the wing chair, I had suddenly felt an urgent need to go to the Graben and the K�rntnerstrasse, because the air there was healthy, and because I suddenly found it pleasant to mingle with the morning crowds, both in the Graben <i>and</i> in the K�rntnerstrasse, and no doubt also because I wanted to escape from the months of solitude in my W�hring apartment, to get away from the isolation that had begun to deaden my brain. In recent weeks I had always found it relaxing, both mentally and physically, to walk along the K�rntnerstrasse and the Graben, then back along the Graben and the K�rntnerstrasse. Walking back and forth like this was as beneficial to my mind as it was to my body, and in recent weeks I had walked up the K�rntnerstrasse and the Graben and back <i>every single day</i>, as though there were nothing I needed so much as just to walk up and down the Graben and the K�rntnerstrasse. It was in the K�rntnerstrasse and the Graben that I suddenly recovered my vitality and became myself again, after months of what I can only describe as mental and physical debility; walking along the K�rntnerstrasse and the Graben and back I felt refreshed. <i>All I need to do is to walk up and down like this,</i> I would think to myself, though that was not all I needed. Just to walk up and down, I kept on telling myself. And in fact it did enable me to start thinking again, even to philosophize, to take an interest once more in philosophy and literature, which had for so long been suppressed, even killed, within me. It was a mistake, as I now realize, to spend the winter in Vienna and not, like previous winters, in London, I thought, sitting in the wing chair. It was this long, sickening winter that killed off everything literary and philosophical there was inside me, and now I&#x2019;ve made it all come back by walking up and down the Graben and the K�rntnerstrasse. And I actually attributed my Viennese mental condition, <i>my restored mental condition,</i> as I now felt able to call it, to the therapy I had first prescribed for myself in the middle of January, this Graben and K�rntnerstrasse therapy. This dreadful city of Vienna, I thought, having plunged me yet again into profound despair and utter hopelessness, has suddenly become the motor that enables my mind to function again as a living mind and my body as a living body; day by day I observed the progressive revival of mind and body, of everything inside me that had been dead during the whole of the winter; having blamed Vienna throughout the winter for my mental and physical atrophy, it was to Vienna that I now owed my restored vitality. I sat in the wing chair and silently paid tribute to the K�rntnerstrasse and the Graben, ascribing my mental and physical recovery solely to my K�rntnerstrasse and Graben therapy; and I told myself that I naturally had to pay a price for this therapy, and meeting the Auersbergers in the Graben, I thought, was the price of its success. It&#x2019;s a very high price, I thought, but it could have been much higher; after all I could have met much worse people in the Graben, for the Auersbergers aren&#x2019;t the worst people in the world, at least not the very worst. All the same it&#x2019;s bad enough to have met the Auersbergers in the Graben, I thought, sitting in the wing chair. A strong person, with strength of character to match, would have declined their invitation, I thought, but I&#x2019;m not strong and I&#x2019;ve no strength of character: on the contrary I&#x2019;m the very weakest person, with the very weakest character, and that&#x2019;s what makes me more or less everyone&#x2019;s victim. And again I reflected that it had been a grave mistake to accept this couple&#x2019;s invitation: having resolved to have nothing more to do with them for the rest of my life, I cross the Graben, only to be accosted by them; they ask me whether I&#x2019;ve heard about Joana&#x2019;s death, about her hanging herself, and then I go and accept their invitation. I momentarily gave way to the most shameful sentimentality, I thought, and the Auersbergers immediately took advantage of it; they took advantage of the suicide of our mutual friend Joana, I thought, to issue their invitation, which I at once accepted, though it would have been wiser to turn it down. But I didn&#x2019;t have the time, I thought, sitting in the wing chair: they <i>came up on me from behind</i> and told me what I already knew&#x2014;that Joana had hanged herself at Kilb, at her parents&#x2019; home&#x2014;and then they invited me to dinner, to a <i>very artistic dinner,</i> they stressed&#x2014;<i>all our friends from the old days</i>. They&#x2019;d actually begun to walk on ahead of me when they issued their invitation, I thought, and they were already a few yards in front when I said <i>yes</i>, accepting their invitation and saying I&#x2019;d come to their dinner party in this hideous apartment in the Gentzgasse. They were carrying a number of parcels, paper-wrapped parcels from various well-known shops in the center of the city, and they were wearing the same English overcoats they had worn thirty years before for shopping expeditions to the city center. Everything about them was what is called <i>shabby-genteel</i>. Actually <i>she did all the talking in the Graben: her husband, a composer in the Webern tradition</i> as he is described, didn&#x2019;t say a word to me, wishing to offend me by not speaking to me, I thought as I sat in the wing chair. They had said that they had no idea when Joana&#x2019;s funeral at Kilb would take place. I had been informed that day by a childhood friend of Joana&#x2019;s, just before I left home, that Joana had hanged herself. This friend, who runs a general store in Kilb, did not want to tell me over the telephone that Joana had <i>hanged</i> herself; she simply told me that she had <i>died,</i> but I told her outright that Joana had <i>not died,</i> but <i>killed herself</i>. She, as her friend, must know how she had done it, I said, but she simply would not tell me. Country people are more inhibited than townspeople about saying openly that <i>somebody has killed himself,</i> and they find it hardest of all to say how. I guessed at once that Joana had hanged herself; in fact I said to the woman from the general store, <i>Joana hanged herself, didn&#x2019;t she?</i> She was taken aback and simply said <i>Yes</i>. People like Joana hang themselves, I said. They don&#x2019;t throw themselves in the river or jump out of fourth-floor windows: they get a piece of rope, deftly tie a noose in it, attach it firmly to a beam, then let themselves drop into the noose. <i>Ballerinas and actresses hang themselves,</i> I told the woman from the general store. The fact that I had not heard from Joana for so long, I thought, sitting in the wing chair, had for some time struck me as suspicious, and I had often wondered lately whether Joana, a woman who had been deeply wounded, who had been cheated, deserted and scorned, might one day commit suicide. But in the Graben I had <i>pretended</i> to the Auersbergers that I knew nothing of Joana&#x2019;s suicide, feigning utter astonishment and shock, even though by eleven o&#x2019;clock in the Graben I was no longer astonished or shocked by the tragedy, having heard about it at seven o&#x2019;clock that morning; after walking up and down the Graben and the K�rntnerstrasse several times I found I was able to <i>endure</i> Joana&#x2019;s suicide, that I was able to bear it, in the bracing air of the Graben. Actually it would have been better had I not appeared utterly astonished by the Auersbergers&#x2019; announcement of Joana&#x2019;s suicide; I should have told them that I had known about it for some time and that I even knew <i>how</i> she had killed herself. I ought to have told them the precise circumstances, I thought, and so deprived them of their triumph, which they were actually reveling in and savoring to the full, as I noted at the time while we were standing in front of Knizes&#x2019;; for by pretending to know nothing whatever about Joana&#x2019;s death, by acting as though I had been stunned and shattered and dumbfounded by the terrible news, I had allowed the Auersbergers the thrill of being the sudden bearers of ill tidings, which naturally had not been my intention, though this was what I managed to achieve by my ineptitude, by claiming to know nothing whatever about Joana&#x2019;s suicide at the time of our meeting. All the time I was standing there with the Auersbergers I feigned ignorance, while knowing more or less everything about Joana&#x2019;s suicide. I did not know how they came to know that Joana had hanged herself, but the likelihood was that they too had been told by the woman from the general store. She would certainly have told them what she told me, I thought, though <i>not as much</i>; otherwise the Auersbergers would have told me more than they did about Joana&#x2019;s suicide. Of course they would be going to the funeral at Kilb, Auersberger&#x2019;s wife said, and she said it in a way which suggested that it would not be a matter of course for me to go to Joana&#x2019;s funeral; it was a kind of reproach, implying that I might possibly <i>not</i> go to Joana&#x2019;s funeral, that I might even find it convenient to avoid going to the funeral of our mutual friend, even though, like them, I had been on terms of the <i>most intimate friendship with her for so many years, indeed for decades</i>. The way she said it, I thought, was actually insulting, as was the fact that, after saying she would see me at Joana&#x2019;s funeral, she immediately went on to invite me to come to their so-called <i>artistic dinner</i> in the Gentzgasse the following Tuesday, that is, today, the day of Joana&#x2019;s funeral. It was in fact through Auersberger that I had first met Joana thirty years before, at a birthday party given for her husband in the Sebastiansplatz, in the Third District, a so-called <i>studio party</i> attended by nearly all the well-known artists of Vienna. Joana&#x2019;s husband was a so-called tapestry artist, a carpet weaver in other words, who had originally been a painter, and he had once won the first prize with one of his carpets at the Bienal in S�o Paulo in the mid-sixties. That Joana should commit suicide was the last thing they would have expected, the Auersbergers had said in the Graben, and before rushing off with all their parcels they told me that they had bought <i>everything by Ludwig Wittgenstein,</i> so that they could <i>immerse themselves in Wittgenstein during the coming weeks</i>. They&#x2019;ve probably got Wittgenstein in the smallest parcel, I thought, the one dangling from her right arm. And again I reflected that it had been a grave error to accept the Auersbergers&#x2019; invitation, considering how I detest all such invitations, and how for so many years I had avoided invitations to <i>artistic dinners</i> of this kind, having attended so many of them until I was well into my forties. I was thoroughly familiar with what they were like&#x2014;and I know of scarcely anything more repugnant. Actually these Auersberger invitations haven&#x2019;t changed, I thought, sitting in the wing chair: they&#x2019;re just the same as they were in the fifties, when they not only bored me to death, but drove me half demented. For twenty years you&#x2019;ve detested the Auersbergers, I told myself, sitting in the wing chair, and then you run into them in the Graben and accept their invitation, and you actually turn up in the Gentzgasse at the appointed time. What&#x2019;s more, you know all the others who&#x2019;ve been invited to this dinner party, and still you turn up. And it struck me that I would have done better to spend this evening&#x2014;or rather this whole night&#x2014;reading Gogol or Dostoevski or Chekhov, rather than to come to this hateful dinner party in the Gentzgasse.</p><h2>LA Popessa</h2><p>An account of the remarkable, controversial activities of the Bavarian-born nun, Sister Pascalina, who rose from obscurity to become confidante, nurse, and adviser to Pope Pius XII</p><p></p><h2>The Journey to the West, Volume 2</h2><p><i>The Journey to the West</i>, volume 2, comprises the second twenty-five chapters of Anthony C.

He is coauthor, with his brother Dennis, of <em>The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching,</em> and the author of <em>Food of the Gods.</em></p>Readers of Food of the Gods (1992) will recall McKenna's diverting claim that the ingestion in ancient times of hallucinogenic mushrooms spurred human consciousness into wakefulness and sophistication. Here, this consummate storyteller tells of his first life-changing encounter with magic mushrooms, in 1971 in the Colombian Amazon. Veteran of the Berkeley riots of the 1960's and of a self- imposed exile in India and Indonesia--during which he smoked pot, studied alternative religions, collected butterflies, and steered clear of the FBI--McKenna was inspired in 1971 to journey to La Chorrera, Colombia, in search of the psychedelic brew ayahuasca and any plants containing the hallucinogenic drug DMT. Joined by his devoted 18-year-old brother, Dennis, and by several other Americans, McKenna reached the Putumayo River only to be sidetracked by a chance ingestion of some magic mushrooms growing in a field. One mushroom led to another, and soon the wildly philosophizing Dennis had devised an experiment to determine whether the production of a cicada-like noise could bind the wisdom of the mushroom with his own DNA. The local Indians may have laughed as the Americans stumbled through the rain forest chasing flying saucers and talking to themselves, but McKenna's newfound conviction that the mushroom showed the way to higher consciousness determined the very uneven course of his future life and career. Now, 20 years later--on the brink of divorce from a woman the mushroom told him was his destiny, and pressed to earn money for their two kids--McKenna relates his journey of psychedelic self- discovery and study with refreshing candor, humor, and occasional rue. All of which makes this, if hardly a convincing scientific treatise (``My dear young friend, these ideas are not even fallacious,'' said Gunther Stent, a molecular geneticist at Berkeley), certainly a captivating, all-too-human tale. Here's one man who proudly--even passionately--inhaled. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The narrative consists of seven imaginary pre-Renaissance diaries, presented in sequence, beginning with the thundering voice of the famous 16th-century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus, defiant, belligerent, egotistical foe of medical orthodoxy. Paracelsus seeks correspondences between the microcosm and the macrocosm, as does the unnamed humanistic philosopher whose ruminations bring the colloquy full circle. In between we hear from an alchemical novice, an old skeptic, an open-minded physician, a devout Christian historian and a revolutionary who spouts apocalyptic forebodings. Connell ( Son of the Morning Star ) achieves moments of great beauty in luxuriant, if sometimes overwrought prose that seems to have sprung from the late Middle Ages. If his novel comes off as hermetic, a failed alchemical experiment, it nevertheless commands thoughtful attention, its surface resplendent with forgotten lore of alchemy, science and love. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The ancient art of alchemy has fascinated writers for centuries, novelist Connell being no exception. Perhaps best known for the television and recent movie adaptations of his works Son of the Morning Star , Mr. Bridge , and Mrs. Bridge , Connell here delves into more obscure matters. Consisting of a series of journals told from the viewpoints of seven alchemists, this work explores alchemy and its relationship to life. Although written in an antique style, the journal entries nonetheless offer contemporary wisdom, especially on the subject of healing. However, despite its creativity, the book uses technical and esoteric vocabulary that will present difficulty for all but the most determined reader. This is a book for those who enjoy the puzzling and who share Connell's enthusiasm for the subject.<br><i>- Nancy R.

For the Rabbi, argument with another person is the highest form of respect you can pay to him. So the Rabbi argues with Jesus because he respects him so much and he argues about what is important: the apparent conflict between the words of Jesus and the Torah&#34;.--Andrew M. Greeley. &#34;By far the most important book for the Jewish-Christian dialogue to have been published in the last decade&#34;.--Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger.</p><p>A fascinating, challenging, imaginary dialogue between Jesus and a distinguished modern rabbi explores and debates the difference between Judaism and Christianity in a uniquely enlightening way.In a highly challenging, contentious exegesis that is almost certain to provoke interfaith dialogue, an eminent scholar of Judaism explains why, if he had lived in Israel in the first century, he would have refused to join Jesus and his circle of disciples. Neusner, whose books include Jews and Christians and (with Andrew M. Greeley) The Bible and Us , argues that the Jesus of the Gospel of St. Matthew called into question the primacy of the family and violated the sanctity of the Sabbath. Casting himself as a local rabbi in biblical times, Neusner engages in an imaginary dialogue with Jesus, a Jew who explicitly claimed that he came to fulfill the Torah, not to destroy it. To Neusner, Jesus's message, summed up as "leave home, follow me," shortchanged the priorities of home, family, community and the social order that the Torah had commanded Israel to bring into being. Neusner's earnest polemic will compel both Jews and Christians to look more deeply at the sources of their faith. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Auntie Poldi And The Vineyards Of Etna (An Auntie Poldi Adventure, 2)</h2><p><b>When Auntie Poldi finds a body in a vineyard, she sets out to solve another murder&#x2014;with the Mafia nipping at her heels&#x2014;in the next adventure from this national bestselling &#x201c;smash series.&#x201d; (<i>People</i> Magazine)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a new star in the mystery firmament, and her name is Auntie Poldi.&#x201d; &#x2014; Alan Bradley&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> "Long may she reign.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Kirkus</i> (starred review)<br><br> When Prosecco-loving Auntie Poldi retired to Sicily from Germany, she never dreamed her tranquil days would be interrupted by murder.

With the addition of three new titles--<i>Matthew's Dream, An Extraordinary Egg</i>, and <i>Six Crows</i>--this magnificent treasury now contains 16 unabridged stories, including three Caldecott Honor books and Lionni's inimitable full-color artwork gracing every page. Add a striking new cover and a fascinating introduction by the author, and this is a volume no Lionni fan will want to be without.<br><br> In a pointer review of the 1985 edition, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> said, "Lionni's stories are simple and elegant, his pictures are nothing short of stunning. Splashy colors, inventive collages, whimsy, and a sense of wonder are all here in abundance. A splendid collection...not to be missed."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When award-winning author and illustrator Leo Lionni was young, he answered the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" with a thoroughly unique reply: "The bell of the trolley car." He continued taking the nontraditional approach to life, writing his first children's book at age 50. Since then, he has written 39 more books, 16 of which appear (partially illustrated) in this lovely treasury, which includes a personal introduction by the author. The collection features such enduring, endearing favorites as <i>Frederick</i>, <i>Fish Is Fish</i>, <i>Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</i>, <i>Cornelius</i>, <i>Swimmy</i>, <i>A Color of His Own</i>, and <i>Six Crows</i>. The texts are included in their unabridged forms, illustrated by a representative selection of Lionni's ever playful watercolors and bold paper cutouts. <p> In his introduction, Lionni notes an affinity with the titular character from the Caldecott Honor recipient <i>Swimmy</i>. In this uplifting tale of ichthyic teamwork, a school of tiny fish swims in formation to look like a large, formidable predator. "I'll be the eye," Swimmy volunteers. Indeed, Lionni has "been the eye" for countless delighted children, translating his astute social vision into meaningful stories and beautiful illustrations featuring field mice, crocodiles, frogs, and chameleons. To have a sampling of so many of Lionni's enchanting creations together in one book is truly a gift--you'll be as happy as we are that he didn't pursue the trolley-bell thing.

Watson lives with his wife and their sons in Port Townsend, Washington, where he enjoys listening to reggae music while he paints.`In my 'hood, battles is fought every day,' quips Marcus, an angry middle schooler on the brink of big trouble. His words, rife with frustration, tumble across page after page in free-flowing verse as he paints a picture of his quickly fading innocence. In the short time since his sister's death, memories of eating ice cream and giggling have been replaced by the bleak reality of a persistent bully, fist fights, and an absent dad. After begrudgingly meeting CM, Chess Master, the school's `bad dude' chess club adviser, an extended `battle' metaphor unfolds, concluding as Marcus takes responsibility for his own actions and moves his fighting off the street and onto the chessboard. . . . Chess Rumble works, and works well. Neri expertly captures Marcus's voice and delicately teases out his alternating vulnerability and rage. The cadence and emotion of the verse are masterfully echoed through Watson's expressive acrylic illustrations. Blacks, whites, and grays echo the concrete world of Marcus's urban home and, even more so, his despairing mood. Scattered chess pieces evoke the crescendo of the boy's temper. The closing scene tenderly catches tough-guy Marcus in a smile as he pounds fists with CM before sitting down to do battle, a stark contrast to his opening image, one dominated entirely by his fist. This book will become a standby pick for reluctant readers, who will be pulled in before they know it by the story's quick pace and the authenticity of Marcus's voice and experience. -- <i>School Library Journal</i></p><h2>Lizards on the Mantel, Burros at the Door: A Big Bend Memoir</h2><p><p>A woman who went West with her husband in the 1840s must have expected hardships and privation, but during the 1940s, when Etta Koch stopped off in Big Bend with her young family and a 23-foot travel trailer in tow, she anticipated no more than a civilized camping trip between her old home in Ohio and a new one in Arizona.

She rolled over, tapped me on the shoulder, and whispered, "Let's go swimming." It was two in the morning under a full moon, and I said, "Okay." The tap on the shoulder usually meant she knew something I didn't, and from the moment I'd met her, Maggie had known a lot that I didn't. <br> <br> We rolled out, grabbed a couple of towels, and held hands down to the river, where Maggie took a swan dive into the South Carolina moonlight. I dropped the towels on the bank and waded in, letting the sandy bottom sift through my toes and the bream shoot between my knees. Leaning backward, I dunked my head, closed my eyes, then let the water roll down my neck as I stood in the waist-deep black river. Summer had run too long, as summers in Digger often do, and the breeze was a welcome comfort. We swam around in the dark water long enough to cool off, and Maggie spread a towel over the bleached white sand. Then she lay down and rested her head on my shoulder, and the moon fell behind the cypress canopy. <br> <br> A while later, as we walked back to the house, her shoulder tucked under mine, Maggie knew that we had just made our son. I didn't know until four weeks later, when she came bouncing off the front porch and tackled me in the cornfield. Grinning, she shoved a little white stick in my face and pointed at the pink line. <br> <br> Soon after, I started noticing the changes. They began in our second bedroom. Previously an office, it quickly became "the nursery." Maggie returned from the hardware store with two gallons of blue paint for the walls and one gallon of white for the trim and molding. <br> <br> "What if she's a girl?" I asked.<br> <br> "He's not," she said and handed me a paintbrush. So we spread some old sheets across the hardwood floors and started goofing off like Tom and Huck. By the end of the night, we were covered in blue paint and the walls were not, but at least we'd made a start. <br> <br> The smell of paint drove us out of the house, so Maggie and I shopped the Saturday morning garage sales. We found a used crib for sixty dollars, the top railing dented with teeth marks. Maggie ran her fingers along the dents like Helen Keller reading Braille. "It's perfect," she said. <br> <br> We set up the crib in the corner of the nursery and made a Sunday afternoon drive to Charleston to the so-called "wholesale" baby outlet. I have never seen more baby stuff in one place in my entire life. And to be honest, before going there, I didn't know half of it existed. When we walked through the sliding glass doors, a recorded voice said, "Welcome to Baby World! If we don't have it, your baby doesn't need it!" The tone of voice gave me my first hint that I was in trouble. <br> <br> Maggie grabbed two pushcarts, shoved one into my stomach, put on her game face, and said, "Come on!" Midway down the first aisle I was in way over my head. We bought diapers, wipes, pacifiers, a tether for the pacifiers, bottles, nipples for the bottles, liners for the bottles, bottles to hold the bottles and keep the bottles warm, cream for diaper rash, ointment for diaper rash, powder for diaper rash, a car seat, blankets, rattles, a changing table, little buckets to organize all the stuff we had just bought, a baby bag, extra ointment, cream, and powder just for the baby bag, booties, a little hat to keep his head warm, and little books. About halfway through the store I quit counting and just said, "Yes, ma'am." <br> <br> To Maggie, every detail, no matter how small, had meaning. She must have said, "Oh, look at this," or "Isn't this cute?" a hundred times. When we reached the checkout counter, we were leaning on two ridiculously overflowing carts. <br> <br> Some marketing genius had stacked the most expensive teddy bears right up in front. Only a blind man was without excuse. Maggie, wearing a baggy pair of denim overalls, batted her big brown eyes and tilted her head. In a deep, whispery, and all-too-seductive voice, she said, "Dylan, this bear's name is Huckleberry." <br> <br> I just laughed. What else could I do? <br> <br> I loaded up the truck and started to breathe easy, thinking the damage was over, but we didn't even make it out of the parking lot. Just next door to Baby World stood a maternity clothing store. Maggie, the possessed power shopper, stalked the racks and piled me high for over an hour. When I could no longer see above the heap of clothes in my arms, she led me to the changing room, where, for the first time in my life, a woman actually told me to come inside with her. Maggie shut the door, slid the latch, and pulled her hair up into a bouncy ponytail. <br> <br> Over the next hour, my wife modeled each item of clothing while I marveled. The only light was a recessed forty-watt bulb above her head, but when she turned, lifted the ponytail off her neck, and whispered, "Unzip me," the light showered her five-eight frame like Tinkerbell's pixie dust. It fluttered off the blond, fuzzy hair on the back of her neck and the sweat on her top lip, over her square tan shoulders and down into the small of her back, along her thin hips and long runner's legs, and then finally swirled around the muscular shape of her calves. <br> <br> <i>God, I love my wife.</i> <br> <br> From shorts to shirts, pants, dresses, skirts, maternity bras, nursing bras, six-month underwear, nine-month underwear, jackets, and sweatshirts, the fashion show continued. As she tried on each item, Maggie stuffed the "eight-pound" pillow inside her waistband, put her hand on her hip, leaned forward on her toes, and looked at herself in the mirror. "Do you think this makes me look fat?"<br> <br> "Maggs, no man in his right mind would ever answer that question."<br> <br> "Dylan," she said, pointing her finger, "answer my question."<br> <br> "You're beautiful." <br> <br> "If you're lying to me," she said, raising her eyebrows and cocking her head, "you're on the couch." <br> <br> "Yes, ma'am."<br> <br> Leaving the dressing room, Maggie shone in full, glorious, pregnant-woman glow. Three hundred and twenty-seven dollars later, she was ready for any occasion. <br> <br> Life had never been more vivid, more colorful, as if God had poured the other end of the rainbow all around us. Rows of cotton, corn, soybean, peanuts, and watermelon rose from the dirt and formed a quilted patchwork, sewing itself with kudzu along the sides of the old South Carolina highway. Ancient gnarled and sprawling oaks covered in moss and crawling with red bugs and history swayed in the breeze and stood like silent sentinels over the plowed rows. Na�ve and unaware, we rumbled along the seams while Maggie placed my hand on her tummy and smiled.<br> <br> At twelve weeks we went for the first ultrasound. Maggie was starting to get what she called a "pooch" and could not have been prouder. When the doctor walked in, Maggie was lying on the table with a fetal monitor Velcroed across her stomach, holding my hand. The doc switched on the ultrasound machine, squeezed some gel on her stomach, and started waving the wand over her tummy. When she heard the heartbeat for the first time, Maggie started crying. "Dylan," she whispered, "that's our son."<br> <br> At sixteen weeks, the nurse confirmed Maggie's intuition. Maggie lay on the same table as the nurse searched her tummy with the ultrasound wand and then stopped when my son gave us a peek at his equipment. "Yep," the nurse said, "it's a boy. Right proud of himself too." <br> <br> I hit my knees. At twenty-nine years old, I had looked inside my wife's tummy and seen our son. As big as life, with his heart beating, and wiggling around for all the world to see. <br> <br> "Hey, Sport." <br> <br> That started my conversations with Maggie's stomach. Every night from that day forward, I'd talk to my small and growing son. The three of us would lie in bed; I'd lift Maggie's shirt just over her tummy, press my lips next to the peach-fuzzy skin near her belly button, and we'd talk. Football, girls, school, farming, tractors, dogs, cornfields, friends, colors, anything I could think of. I just wanted my son to know the sound of my voice. After a few days, he started kicking my lips. Before I told him good night, I'd sing "Johnny Appleseed," "Daddy Loves His Sweet Little Boy," "The Itsy-Bitsy Spider," or "Jesus Loves Me." <br> <br> Sometimes in the middle of the night, when the baby kicked or pushed his foot into the side of her stomach, Maggie would grab my hand and place it on her tummy. She never said a word, but I woke up feeling the warmth of my wife's stomach and the outline of my son's foot. <br> <br> Toward the end of the first trimester, while rummaging through a yard sale, I found a rickety old rocking horse that needed a lot of glue, some elbow grease, and a few coats of white paint. I brought it home, set up my woodworking shop in the barn, and told Maggie to stay out. A week later, I brought it inside and set it next to the crib. Maggie looked at it, and the tears came forth in a flood. I think that was my first realization that new hormones had taken over my wife's body and mind. <br> <br> Pretty soon the cravings hit. "Sweetheart." It was that whispery, seductive voice again. "I want some fresh, natural peanut butter and H�agen Dazs raspberry sorbet." <br> <br> I never knew it would be so difficult to find freshly churned natural peanut butter at ten o'clock at night. When I got back to the house, Maggie was standing on the front porch, tapping her foot and wielding a spoon. As soon as I got the lids off, we...</p></p><h2>Mercedes-Benz 190 Service And Repair Manual</h2><p>Saloon, Hatchback, Liftback and Estate, inc. special/limited editions.

He introduces the reader to all the characters in this timeless story, showing that it concerns not just a wayward son, but also a judgemental older brother and, most importantly, a loving father. In this challenging and inspiring book, Timothy Keller invites both faithful believers and curious outsiders to come to a new and totally life-changing understanding of the central message of the Christian faith.</p><p>Timothy Keller was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and educated at Bucknell University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Westminster Theological Seminary. He was pastor of West Hopewell Presbyterian Church, Virginia, for nine years before founding Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, which he started in 1989 with his wife, Kathy, and three young sons.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>This short book is meant to lay out the essentials of the Christian message, the gospel. It can, therefore, serve as an introduction to the Christian faith for those who are unfamiliar with its teachings or who may have been away from them for some time.<br><br>This volume is not just for seekers, however. Many lifelong Christian believers feel they understand the basics of the Christian faith quite well and don't think they need a primer. Nevertheless, one of the signs that you may not grasp the unique, radical nature of the gospel is that you are certain that you do. Sometimes longtime church members find themselves so struck and turned around by a fresh apprehension of the Christian message that they feel themselves to have been essentially "re-converted." This book, then, is written to both curious outsiders and established insiders of the faith, both to those Jesus calls "younger brothers" and those he calls "elder brothers" in the famous Parable of the Prodigal Son.<br><br>I am turning to this familiar story, found in the fifteenth chapter of the gospel of St. Luke, in order to get to the heart of the Christian faith. The parable's plot and <i>dramatis personae</i> are very simple. There was a father who had two sons. The younger asked for his share of the inheritance, received it, and promptly left for a far country, where he squandered it all on sensual and frivolous pleasure. He returned home penitently and, to his surprise, was received with open arms by his father. This reception alienated and angered the elder brother greatly. The story closes with the father appealing to his firstborn son to join in the welcome and forgiveness of his younger brother.<br><br>On the surface of it, the narrative is not all that gripping. I believe, however, that if the teaching of Jesus is likened to a lake, this famous Parable of the Prodigal Son would be one of the clearest spots where we can see all the way to the bottom. Many excellent studies have been written on this Biblical text over the last several years, but the foundation for my understanding of it was a sermon I first heard preached over thirty years ago by Dr. Edmund P. Clowney. Listening to that sermon changed the way I understood Christianity. I almost felt I had discovered the secret heart of Christianity. Over the years I have often returned to teach and counsel from the parable. I have seen more people encouraged, enlightened, and helped by this passage, when I explained the true meaning of it, than by any other text.<br><br>I once traveled overseas and delivered this sermon to an audience through an interpreter. Some time later the translator wrote to tell me that, as he was preaching the sermon, he had realized that the parable was like an arrow aimed at his heart. After a period of wrestling and reflection, it brought him to faith in Christ. Many others have told me that this story of Jesus, once they came to understand it, saved their faith, their marriages, and, sometimes literally, their lives.<br><br>In the first five chapters I will unlock the parable's basic meaning. In Chapter 6 I will demonstrate how the story helps us understand the Bible as a whole, and in Chapter 7 how its teaching works itself out in the way we live in the world.<br><br>I will not use the parable's most common name: the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It is not right to single out only one of the sons as the sole focus of the story. Even Jesus doesn't call it the Parable of <i>the</i> Prodigal Son, but begins the story saying, "a man had <i>two</i> sons." The narrative is as much about the elder brother as the younger, and as much about the father as the sons. And what Jesus says about the older brother is one of the most important messages given to us in the Bible. The parable might be better called the Two Lost Sons.<br><br>The word "prodigal" does not mean "wayward" but, according to <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i>, "recklessly spendthrift." It means to spend until you have nothing left. This term is therefore as appropriate for describing the father in the story as his younger son. The father's welcome to the repentant son was literally reckless, because he refused to "reckon" or count his sin against him or demand repayment. This response offended the elder son and most likely the local community. <br><br>In this story the father represents the Heavenly Father Jesus knew so well. St. Paul writes: "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses" (2 Corinthians 5:19 &#x2013; American Standard Version). Jesus is showing us the God of Great Expenditure, who is nothing if not prodigal toward us, his children. God's reckless grace is our greatest hope, a life-changing experience, and the subject of this book.</p><h2>Profiles of the Future : An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible</h2><p>Examines the potential future directions of technological development and assesses the advantages and disadvantages of progress</p><p>Arthur C.

Annie Proulx) whose melancholy beauty resonates with the deepest truths (Boston Globe).</p><p>Healy is a playwright and poet and is a member of Asodana, the academy of distinguished Irish writers.Healy addresses the antipathies of contemporary Ireland-the whole island, both Ulster and the Republic of Ireland-with dogged intensity and honesty. Effectively the story of the breakup of the relationship between Catholic playwright Jack Ferris and Protestant actress Catherine Adams, the novel opens in Donegal, in the west of Ireland, as Jack slowly realizes that a combination of cultural misunderstandings and his own alcoholism have driven his lover from him. Forced to come to terms with his loss, he determines to recreate Catherine in his imagination, and the novel delves into the past to examine the social and psychological landscape of the fractured world to which they both belong. Protestant and Catholic Ireland are drawn together in the complex person of Jonathan Adams, Catherine's father, a stern Northern Protestant policeman equally attracted to and repelled by the Catholic South. Towards the end of his life, Jonathan finds himself spending more time in his holiday home in a relatively unsophisticated Southern community; but, after years of summerlong visits there, he remains an outsider-unable even to master the rudiments of casual greeting and conversation. Jonathan's difficulties are mirrored by Jack's later attempts to maintain a normal life as a playwright in violence-torn Belfast, where he has moved with Catherine, and where he begins to understand that he, too, is fundamentally an outsider. This long, resolutely bleak story (the title derives from the Greek word for "tragedy") evokes both the bitterness and the wistfulness of people caught in the center of Ireland's religious divide. Although the prose is occasionally less than beautiful, Healy's complex characterizations and powerful narrative drive make this a consistently gripping and ultimately moving novel. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>He-Man: The Eternity War Vol. 2</h2><p>The war for Eternia reaches its epic conclusion!<br> &nbsp;<br> The Eternity War seems all but over.

Joseph Luzzi found the answer in the opening of <em>The Divine Comedy</em>: &#x201c;In the middle of our life&#x2019;s journey, I found myself in a dark wood.&#x201d;</p><p>When Luzzi&#x2019;s pregnant wife was in a car accident&#x2014;and died forty-five minutes after giving birth to their daughter, Isabel&#x2014;he finds himself a widower and first-time father at the same moment. While he grieves and cares for his infant daughter, miraculously delivered by caesarean before his wife passed, he turns to Dante&#x2019;s <em>Divine Comedy</em> for solace.</p><p><em>In a Dark Wood</em> tells the story of how Dante helps the author rebuild his life.

He heard steady breathing from the still forms of his two companions, and marveled at their ease.<br>He had written in his notebook:<br>* * *<br>The mound is approximately five hundred meters long and half as wide, perhaps a hundred meters high, (apparently) the basaltic cinder cone of a dead volcano, covered with boulder- and cobble-sized chunks of dark black scoria and surrounded by fine white quartz sand. It is not on our maps nor in the 1991 Geosat directory. The flanks of the cone are steeper than the angle of repose, as much as fifty and sixty degrees. The weathering is haphazard at best--some parts open to the sun and rain are jet black, shiny, and other areas are only mildly rusty. There are no insects on the mound--specifically, lift any rock and you will <i>not</i> find a scorpion or millipede. There are no beer cans.<br>* * *<br>Edward, Brad Minelli, and Victor Reslaw had journeyed from Austin, Texas, to combine a little geology with a lot of camping and hiking across the early autumn desert. Edward was the eldest, thirty-three; he was also the shortest and in a close race with Reslaw to lose his hair the fastest. He stood five feet nine inches in his hiking boots, and his slender frame and boyish, inquisitive features made him seem a lot younger, despite the thinning hair. To see objects closer than two feet from his round nose, he wore gold wire-framed round-lensed glasses, a style he had adopted as an adolescent in the late seventies.<br>Edward lay on his back with his hands clasped behind his head and stared up at the clear steady immensity of the sky. Three days before, dark and gravid clouds had conspired in the flaming sunset to drop a true gully-washer into Death Valley. Their camp had been on high ground, but they had seen basketball-sized boulders slide and roll down freshly gouged channels.<br>The desert seemed once again innocent of water and change. All around the camp hung a silence more precious than any amount of gold. Not even the wind spoke.<br>He felt very large in the solitude, as if he might spread his fingers over half the land from horizon to horizon, and gather a mica coat of stars on his fingers. Conversely, in his largeness, he was also a little frightened. This inflated magnitude of self could easily be pricked and shrink to nothing, an illusion of comfort and warmth and high intellectual fever.<br>Not once in his six-year career as a professor of geology had he found a major error in the U.S. Geological Survey Death Valley charts. The Mojave Desert and Death Valley were the Mecca and Al Medina of western U.S. geologists; they had tramped over the regions for well over a century, drawn by the nakedness and shameless variety of the Earth. From its depths miners had hauled borax and talc and gypsum and other useful, unglamorous minerals. In some places, niter-lined caves wedged several hundred feet into the Earth. A spelunker need descend only twenty or thirty feet to feel the heat; creation still lay close under Death Valley.<br>There were hundreds of dead volcanoes, black or sullen red on the tan and gray and pink desert, between the resort at Furnace Creek and the small town of Shoshone, yet each one had been charted and was likely featured in some graduate research paper or another.<br>This mountain was an anomaly.<br>That was impossible.<br>Reslaw and Minelli had shrugged it off as an interesting if unique error on the maps; a misplacement, like the discovery of some new island in an archipelago, known to the natives but lost in a shuffle of navigators' charts; a kind of Pitcairn of volcanic mounds.<br>But the cinder cone was too close to routes traveled at least once or twice a year. Edward knew that it had not been misplaced. He could not deceive himself as his friends did.<br>Neither could he posit any other explanation.<br>* * *<br>They walked once again around the base of the mound at midmorning. The sun was already high in the flat, still blue sky. It was going to be a hot day. Red-haired, stocky Reslaw sipped coffee from a green-enameled Thermos bottle, a serviceable antique purchased in a rock-and-junk shop in Shoshone; Edward chewed on a granola bar and sketched details in a small black cloth-bound notebook. Minelli trailed them, idly chipping at boulders with a rock pick, his loose, lanky form, unkempt black hair, and pale skin giving him the appearance of a misplaced urban scrounger.<br>He stopped ten yards behind Edward. "Hey," he called out. "Did you see this?"<br>"What?"<br>"A hole."<br>Edward turned back. Reslaw glanced back at them, shrugged, and continued around the mound to the north.<br>The hole was about a meter wide and slanted upward into the mass of the mound. Edward had not seen it because it began in deep shadow, under a ledge illuminated by the warm rays of the sun. "It's not a flow tube. Look how smooth," Minelli said. "No collapse, no patterns."<br>"Bad geology," Edward commented. <i>If the mound is a fake, then this is the first mistake</i>.<br>"Hm?"<br>"It's not natural. Looks like some prospector got here before us."<br>"Why dig a hole in a cinder cone?"<br>"Maybe it's an Indian cave," Edward offered lamely. The hole disturbed him.<br>"Indians with diamond drills? Not likely," Minelli said with a faint edge of scorn. Edward ignored his tone and stepped on a lava boulder to get a better look up into the darkness. He pulled a flashlight from his belt and squeezed it to shine a beam into the depths. Smooth-bored matte-finish lava walls absorbed the light beyond eight or ten meters; to that point, the tunnel was straight and featureless, inclining upward at about thirty degrees.<br>"Do you smell something?" Minelli asked.<br>Edward sniffed. "Yeah. What is it?"<br>"I'm not sure..."<br>The odor was faint and smooth and sweet, slightly acrid. It did not encourage further investigation. "Like a lab smell," Minelli said.<br>"That's it," Edward agreed. "Iodine. Crystalline iodine."<br>"Right."<br>Minelli's forehead wrinkled in a mock fit of manic speculation. "Got it," he said. "This is a junkie rock. A sanitary junkie cinder cone."<br>Edward ignored him again. Minelli was infamous for a sense of humor so strange it hardly ever produced anything funny. "Needle mark," "Minelli explained in an undertone, realizing his failure. "You still think this isn't a map mistake?"<br>"If you found a street in New York City, not on any map, wouldn't you be suspicious?"<br>"I'd call up the mapmakers."<br>"Yeah, well, this place is as crowded as New York City, as far as geologists are concerned."<br>"All right," Minelli conceded. "So it's <i>new</i>. Just popped up out of nowhere."<br>"That sounds pretty stupid, doesn't it?" Edward said.<br>"Your idea, not mine."<br>Edward backed away from the hole and suppressed a shiver. <i>A new mole and it won't go away; a blemish that shouldn't be here</i>.<br>"What's Reslaw doing?" Minelli asked. "Let's find him."<br>"This-a-way," Edward said, pointing north. "We can still catch up."<br>They heard Reslaw call out.<br>He had not gone far. At the northernmost point of the mound's base, they found him squatting on top of a beetle-shaped lava boulder.<br>"Tell me I'm not seeing what I'm seeing," he said, pointing to the shade below the rock. Minelli made a face and hurried ahead of Edward.<br>In the sand, two meters from the boulder, lay something that at first glance resembled a prehistoric flying creature, a pteranodon perhaps, wings folded, canted over to one side.<br>It was not mineral, Edward decided immediately; it certainly didn't resemble any animal he had seen. That it might be a distorted plant, a peculiar variety of succulent or cactus, seemed the most likely explanation.<br>Minelli edged around the find, cautiously giving it a berth of several yards. Whatever it was, it was about the size of a man, bilaterally symmetric and motionless, dusty gray-green with touches of pastel flesh-pink. Minelli stopped his circling and simply gaped.<br>"I don't think it's alive," Reslaw said.<br>"Did you touch it?" Minelli asked.<br>"Hell no."<br>Edward kneeled before it. There was a definite logic to the thing; a kind of head two feet long and shaped rather like a bishop's miter, or a flattened artillery, shell, point down in the sand; a knobby pair of shoulder blades behind the fan-crest of the miter; short thin trunk and twisted legs in squat position behind that. Stubby six-digit feet or hands on the ends of the limbs.<br><i>Not a plant</i>.<br>"Is it a corpse, maybe?" Minelli asked. "Wearing something, like a dog, you know, covered with clothes--"<br>"No," Edward said. He couldn't take his eyes away from the thing. He reached out to touch it, then reconsidered and slowly withdrew his fingers.<br>Reslaw climbed down from the boulder. "Scared me so bad I jumped," he explained. <br>"Jesus Christ," Minelli said. "What do we do?"<br>The snout of the miter lifted from the sand and three glassy eyes the color of fine old sherry emerged. The shock was so great that none of the three moved. Edward finally took a step back, almost reluctantly. The eyes in the miter-head followed him, then sank away again, and the head nodded back into the sand. A sound issued from the thing, muffled and indistinct.<br>"I think we should go," Reslaw said.<br>"It's sick," Minelli said.<br>Edward looked for footprints, hidden strings, signs of a prank. He was already convinced this was no prank, but it was best to be sure before committing oneself to a ridiculous hypothesis.<br>Another muffled noise.<br>"It's saying something," Reslaw said. <br>"Or trying to," Edward added.<br>"It isn't really ugly, is it?" Minelli asked. "It's kind of pretty."<br>Edward hunkered down and approached the thing again, edging forward one booted foot at a time.<br>The thing lifted its head and said very clearly, "I am sorry, but there is bad news."<br>"What?" Edward jerked, his voice cracking.<br>"God almighty," Reslaw cried.<br>"I am sorry, but there is bad news."<br>"Are you sick?" Edward asked.<br>"There i...</p><h2>A Big Ball of String (Beginner Books)</h2><p>After winding a large ball of string, a young boy has fun finding ways of using it</p><p>By Marion Holland, Illustrated by Marion Holland</p><h2>Duden.

Gill Heriz has interviewed over 70 different women, and Nicolette Hallett has photographed their sheds inside and out, to collect together this unique insight into why women have sheds, and what they do in them. There are sheds for puppet-makers, sculptors, and writers, as well as farmers, furniture-makers, and woodcutters. There are sheds that can be lived in, sheds that are full to the rafters, and sheds that are simply sheds, with the usual collection of gardening tools, lawnmowers, and seed packets. Virginia Woolf once argued that, for women, writing fiction required &#x201c;a room of one&#x2019;s own.&#x201d; These women have taken that premise a step further&#x2014;to the end of the backyard&#x2014;to find their own very personal space.</p><p><p>Why should men have all the sheds?</p>Gill Heriz is an artist and writer who was once an interior designer, and has a passion for architecture and design. She is also self-confessedly nosy, and loves nothing more than exploring other people&#x2019;s houses. She is the author of 'A Woman's Shed' (CICO Books), and her interest in the subject was first sparked by some fine examples in her local area, but now extends across the world. Her current shed is a studio built from old flint, where she can work, create, and relax. She is based in Suffolk, UK.</p><h2>The Black Box (Harry Bosch)</h2><p><b>In this "superb" thriller, Detective Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to the unsolved killing of a young female photographer during the 1992 L.A. riots (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>).</b><br> In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved.<br><br>Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue. Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash, Bosch searches for the "black box," the one piece of evidence that will pull the case together.<br><br>Riveting and relentlessly paced, <i>The Black Box</i> leads Harry Bosch, "one of the greats of crime fiction" (<i>New York Daily News</i>), into one of his most fraught and perilous cases.</p><p>Michael Connelly is the author of the recent #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <em>The Drop</em>, <em>The Fifth Witness, The Reversal</em>, <i>The Scarecrow</i>, <i>The Brass Verdict</i>, and <i>The Lincoln Lawyer,</i> as well as the bestselling Harry Bosch series of novels.

He is a former newspaper reporter who has won numerous awards for his journalism and his novels. He spends his time in California and Florida.*Starred Review* At his core, Harry Bosch is a cop with a mission&#x2014;to tip the scales of justice toward the side of murder victims and their survivors. The scales can never be righted, of course, even by solving the cases Bosch is assigned in the Open Unsolved Unit of the LAPD. That is especially true in the 20-year-old murder of Danish journalist Anneke Jesperson, who was killed during the L.A. riots of 1992. What was Jesperson, a white woman, doing in South Central L.A. in the aftermath of the riots? As usual, Bosch faces not only the seeming impossibility of reconstructing a crime that has been cold for two decades but also the roadblocks imposed by the bureaucrats at the top of the LAPD. But Bosch has never met a roadblock he wasn&#x2019;t compelled to either barge through or cannily avoid. Harry is such a compelling character largely due to his fundamentally antiestablishment personality, which leads to chaos as often as to triumph, but also because his unswerving work ethic reflects not simply duty but also respect for the task before him. Harry does it right, even&#x2014;or especially&#x2014;when his bosses want something else entirely. That&#x2019;s the case this time&#x2014;How would it look if a white cop made headlines by solving the riot-related murder of a white woman? Better to let it slide. In real life, we all let things slide, but in life according to Bosch, nothing slides. We like Harry, as we like many other fictional crime solvers, because he never stops, but we love him because he has the scars to prove that never sliding is no easy thing. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Connelly&#x2019;s twenty-fifth book appears in his twentieth year of publishing, an anniversary that his publisher has been celebrating throughout 2012 with various &#x201c;Year of Connelly&#x201d; promotions, all leading up to the publication of The Black Box. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The Day the Universe Changed</h2><p>The companion to a BBC television series probing the origins of Western attitudes and institutions focuses on eight periods in history when a change in knowledge dramatically altered human understanding of ourselves and the world around</p><p><p>James Burke, the BBC's chief reporter on the Apollo missions to the moon, was awarded the Royal Television Society silver medal in 1973 and the gold medal in 1974. The PBS series <i>Connections</i> was over two years in the making, the research and filming taking the author to twenty-three countries. James Burke lives in London.</p>James Burke synthesizes the entire course of Western history and science into this brief audiobook about how "knowledge" is subjective to the time and place in which it is created. He takes this argument further in explaining why and how science can be subjective, despite claims to the contrary. He delivers all this in a smooth and crisp British accent that reveals his experience in broadcasting, and his career with the BBC lends his voice subtle authority. However, listeners may feel overwhelmed with his long-winded explanations, which sometimes lose touch with where they started. Burke's delivery needs something more to keep listeners engaged, such as background music or more musical interludes to facilitate transitions.

Brady, however, gets a call from an old friend and former neighbor&#x2014;a man from his past as a happily married man. When Brady was married and living in suburbia, Ken Nichols was his happily married neighbor. Both marriages fell apart years ago and Brady moved to Boston while Ken Nichols moved to Baltimore.

He lived with his wife in Hancock, New Hampshire.One <p>I spotted Ken Nichols about the same time he spotted me. He was sitting at the end of the hotel bar, and when I started toward him, he grinned and raised what looked like a martini glass.</p><p>I took the stool beside him. He held out his hand, and I shook it.</p><p>&#x201c;Glad you could make it, Brady,&#x201d; Ken said. &#x201c;Jesus, it&#x2019;s good to see you. What&#x2019;s it been?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten years,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;At least.&#x201d;</p><p>He was wearing a pearl-colored button-down shirt under a pale blue linen jacket, with faded blue jeans and battered boat shoes. He had a good tan, as if he played golf year-round. His black hair was now speckled with gray and cut shorter than I remembered.</p><p>Ken had big ears and a meandering nose and a mouth that was a little too wide for his face. He grinned easily, he loved animals, and when he spoke, I could still detect the Blue Ridge Mountains of his childhood in his voice. Ken Nichols was an easy guy to like.</p><p>He was a veterinarian, and back when we were neighbors in Wellesley, Ken was the one who gave my dogs their rabies and distemper shots, and I was the lawyer who handled the legal work for his business. We used to play in the same foursome on Sunday mornings, and we invited each other&#x2019;s families over for backyard cookouts on summer weekends.</p><p>Then Ken got divorced, dissolved his veterinary practice, and moved to Baltimore, and shortly after that, I got divorced, too.</p><p>We&#x2019;d been out of touch ever since, but Ken and I used to be pretty good friends, and when he called me earlier in the week, saying he was coming up to Massachusetts to attend this veterinarian convention in the big hotel in Natick and would love to meet me for a drink if I could sneak away, just for old times&#x2019; sake, I agreed instantly. Friends, old or new, were always worth sneaking away for.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking good,&#x201d; I said to him.</p><p>&#x201c;I work out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You get to a certain age, you&#x2019;ve got to take care of the machine, you know what I mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I do know. Change the oil, replace the filters, rotate the tires. I keep thinking I should do something about my brake pads, but...&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled. &#x201c;Same old Brady.&#x201d; He showed me his empty martini glass. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;ll you have? The usual? Jack, rocks?&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled and nodded. &#x201c;You remembered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some things never change.&#x201d;</p><p>The bartender, a Hispanic guy in his twenties with a pencil-thin mustache, must have been listening, because he came over and said, &#x201c;Gentlemen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Another for me,&#x201d; Ken said, &#x201c;and a Jack Daniel&#x2019;s on the rocks for my friend.&#x201d;</p><p>After the bartender turned away, Ken said, &#x201c;So how&#x2019;s your golf game these days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I quit golf a few years ago,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It came down to golf or fishing, and I picked fishing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tough choice, if you love both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I figured out I didn&#x2019;t love them both the same,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;so it was easy. Quitting golf was a helluva lot easier than quitting cigarettes. You&#x2019;re still playing, I bet.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;I joined a country club just outside of Baltimore, and&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped when a cell phone began buzzing and dancing around on the bartop beside his elbow. Ken picked it up and looked at it, flipped it open, and said, &#x201c;Clem? That you, man?&#x201d; He listened for a minute, frowned down at his wristwatch, then lifted his head and gazed around the room. &#x201c;Yeah, okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I see you. Wait there.&#x201d;</p><p>He snapped the phone shut, stuck it in his jacket pocket, and looked at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to do something. It&#x2019;ll take just a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>I waved my hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d;</p><p>The area where I was sitting consisted of a short bartop with a dozen stools plus five or six small tables, all crowded into one corner of an open area off the hotel lobby. Beside the bar was a small raised platform with a piano and a drum set. I guessed a jazz quartet might be performing later on this Friday evening. People&#x2014;mostly veterinarians, I assumed&#x2014;were milling around and lounging on sofas and soft chairs, some of them with laptops propped open on coffee tables, some of them looking up at a wide-screen TV mounted on the wall that was showing a Red Sox game.</p><p>As I watched, Ken weaved through the crowd to the other side of the room and went up to a man who was leaning against the wall with his arms folded over his chest. This man had a neatly trimmed dark beard streaked with gray and a high shiny forehead. He was wearing a dark suit with a maroon necktie. He looked to be in his late forties, early fifies, about the same age as Ken. He kept his arms folded as Ken approached him.</p><p>Ken said something to the man and held out his hand. The man grinned quickly, and they shook. Ken said something, and the other guy frowned and gave his head a quick shake. Ken shrugged and said something else, and the man looked up and turned his head toward the bar. His eyes found me across the room, and he lifted his chin and smiled at me as if he knew me.</p><p>I nodded to him. Maybe I was supposed to recognize him, but I didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>The man turned back to Ken, reached out, put his hand on Ken&#x2019;s arm, pushed his face close to Ken&#x2019;s, and began talking.</p><p>After a minute or two, Ken nodded and stepped away from the bearded guy, who smiled, made a pistol out of his hand, and pointed his index finger at Ken&#x2019;s face. Ken nodded, and the other guy turned and walked out of the room.</p><p>Ken stood there for a minute watching the man go. Then he started back to where I was sitting.</p><p>When I swiveled around to face the bar, I saw that my drink was sitting there on a coaster for me. Ken&#x2019;s new martini had appeared as well.</p><p>Ken eased himself onto the stool beside me. He picked up his martini, downed half of it, and said, &#x201c;Ahh. I needed that.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to him. &#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That guy you were just talking with...&#x201d;</p><p>He waved the back of his hand at me. &#x201c;No big deal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;None of my business.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want another case, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Massachusetts or Mary land?&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;You name it, pal. I got cases here, there, and the Arctic fucking Circle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never passed the Arctic Circle bar,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Otherwise...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Too bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I assume you&#x2019;ve got somebody handling your business,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Someone you can trust.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sure.&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;Some things, it takes more than a lawyer to fix, though.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at him. &#x201c;Are you in some kind of trouble, Ken?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who? That guy?&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;Nah. Not really. He&#x2019;s an old friend.&#x201d; He flapped his hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just life, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because if you are...&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled. &#x201c;I know. Thanks. Good to know. But really, that&#x2019;s not why I wanted to get together. This was just about, you know, hey, it&#x2019;s been, what, ten years&#x2014;eleven, actually&#x2014;I got divorced eleven years ago. We were pretty good friends, you and me. Things were simpler back then. We had some good times, though, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, good times,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Different times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They sure were,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hell, we were both married, for one thing. You haven&#x2019;t remarried, have you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; I shook my head. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve had a couple of pretty serious relationships, but I always managed to screw them up, and they never got quite that far. I still have an open mind on the subject. You?&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m having way too much fun.&#x201d; He drained his martini glass. &#x201c;Another?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good.&#x201d;</p><p>Ken downed two more martinis while I nursed my single shot of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s, and we talked about the good old days when we both were younger, living in the suburbs, raising our kids, mowing our lawns, and playing golf on the weekends. When Ken talked, his eyes bored into mine as if he needed desperately to be understood. He peppered me with a lot of questions&#x2014;what were my sons up to, how was my law practice going, what was Gloria, my ex-wife, doing, where was I living&#x2014;and when I tried to answer them, his eyes would shift and he&#x2019;d be looking past my shoulder, scanning the roomful of people as if he were expecting somebody, not really listening to me.</p><p>Ken&#x2019;s cell phone, lying on the bartop in front of him, buzzed two or three other times while we were sitting there, and each time he picked it up, frowned at the screen, gave me a quick, apologetic smile, and did not answer it.</p><p>We&#x2019;d been there for a little more than an hour when he looked at his watch, drained his glass, took out his wallet, and put some bills on the bar. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I gotta go.&#x201d;</p><p>I reached for my wallet, but he put his hand on my arm. &#x201c;I got it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Worth it, seeing you again, getting caught up a little.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Worth it for me, too,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but we barely scratched the surface.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll do it again, and next time you can buy the drinks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Means there will be a next time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wish we could make an evening out of it,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m on a damn committee, and we&#x2019;ve got a meeting in ten minutes. Thanks a million for trekking over here. Let&#x2019;s not let another ten years go by, okay?&#x201d; He held out his hand.</p><p>I shook it. &#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We should keep in touch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So if I had a legal problem sometime...?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;Sure. Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d; He slapped my shoulder. &#x201c;Say hi to Gloria for me next time you see her,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;And you give my best to Sharon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ken, really,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;if you just want to talk, you know, legal problems or whatever, don&#x2019;t hesitate to give me a call. Anytime.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;I might do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean it,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I do, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you.&#x201d;</p><p>OUTWITTING TROLLS Copyright � 2010 by Vicki Stiefel Tapply</p></p><h2>Home Book of Taxidermy and Tanning</h2><p>Hardcover book with dust jacket. 180 pages including glossary and index.

The graphic novel brings the Halo universe to life for the first time in the sequential art medium in a 128-page, full color, high quality, jacketed, hardcover graphic novel. Stories include: &#34;Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor&#34; by Simon Bisley and Lee Hammock.

Cover by Phil Hale. Gallery art created a number of elite artists including Rick Berry, Geof Darrow, Scott Fischer, Sterling Hundley, Craig Mullins, George Pratt, Juan Ramirez, George Staples, Justin Sweet, John Van Fleet and Kent Williams.</p><p>Based on the wildly popular videogame, this anthology collects four stories by different creators, all set in the Halo universe of the 26th century. The game's central story details a war between Earth's United Nations Space Command and the Covenant, a coalition of hostile alien races. At the center is Master Chief, a UNSC cyborg-marine who discovers the terrible secret of the Halo, a series of ringlike artificial planets. Hardcore Halo fans will love Lee Hammock's "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor," viscerally illustrated by Simon Bisley, detailing the Flood, a nasty parasitic race of monsters that threaten both the Covenant and the human race. For newcomers there's the legendary Moebius's "Second Sunrise over New Mombasa," in which he renders a beautiful, futuristic version of the Kenyan city&#x2014;and deftly surveys the intersection of war propaganda and the media. The book's artwork is skillful and unusual (including a story by Tsutomu Nihei and a gallery by an all-star lineup of artists in the back) and the writing brings the Halo universe and its central tenets to life. But ultimately the reader will yearn for the depth of a real, book-length graphic novel&#x2014;and maybe that's next to come. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in Palatine, Illinois.<br>BOY WHO WOULD LIVE FOREVER<br>1From Istanbul to the StarsIOn Stan's seventeenth birthday the Wrath of God came again, as it had been doing every six weeks or so. At the time Stan was alone in the apartment, cutting up vegetables for his birthday dinner. When he felt that familiar, sudden, overwhelming, disorienting, <i>horny</i> rush of vertigo he knew that it was what everybody he knew called "the Wrath of God" and nobody understood at all. Screams and sirens from outside the building told him that everybody else in that part of Istanbul was feeling it, too. Stan managed to drop the paring knife to the floor so he wouldn't cut himself. Then he staggered to a kitchen chair to wait it out.People said the Wrath was a terrible thing. Well, that was true enough. Whatever the Wrath of God really was, it struck everyone in the world at once--and not just the people still living on Earth, either. Ships in space, the colonies on Mars and Venus, as long as human beings were still within the confines of the Solar System, they all were caught up in its madness at the same moment, and the Wrath's costs in accidents and disasters were enormous. Personally, Stan didn't mind it all that much. What it felt like to him was like suddenly being overwhelmedby a vast, lonely, erotic nightmare. Like, Stan thought, probably what it would be like to get good and drunk. The erotic part was not very different from some of the yearnings Stan himself felt often enough.It didn't last very long. When it passed, Stan shook himself, picked up the things he had knocked to the floor and turned on the local TV news to see how it had gone this time.It had gone badly enough. Fires, car smashes--Istanbul's aggressive drivers relied on their split-second reflexes to avert disaster, and when the Wrath took away their skill the crashes came fast. The single worst thing that happened this time was an oil tanker that had been coming into the Golden Horn. With everyone on both the tanker's tugs and its own bridge suddenly incapacitated, the vessel had plowed, dead slow and irresistible, into one of the cruise-ship docks on the Old City side, and there it had exploded into flame.That was a really bad accident. Like any teenager, however, Stan had a high tolerance for other people's misfortunes. He yawned and got back to his chores, hoping only that the commotion wouldn't make his father too late in getting back home with the saffron and mussels for the birthday stew. When Stan finished with the vegetables he put them in a pot of cold water, and put a couple of his precious old disks on to play. This time it was Dizzy Gillespie, Jack Teagarden and the Firehouse Five Plus Three. Then he sat down to wait as he listened, thumbing through some of his comics and wondering if, this time, his father would have stayed sober long enough to get him some kind of a present for his birthday.That was the moment at which the polis came to the door.There were two of them, male and female, and they looked around the shabby apartment suspiciously. "Is this where the American citizen Walter Avery lived?" the woman demanded, and the past tense of the verb told Stan the whole story.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It didn't take the polis long to tell Stan just how it was that the Wrath had made a statistic of his father. Walter Avery had fallen down while crossing the street and a spellbound taksidriver ran right over him. There was no hope of holding the driver responsible, the woman said at once; the Wrath, you know. Anyway, the driver had long since disappeared. And, besides, witnesses said that Stan's father had been drunk at the time. Of course.The male polis took pity on Stan's wretched stare. "At least he didn't suffer," he said gruffly. "He died right away. There was no pain."The woman was impatient. "Yes, I suppose that is possible," she said, and then: "So you've been notified. You have to come to the morgue to collect the body before midnight, otherwise there'll be a charge for holding it an extra day. Good-bye."And they left.IISince there would be neither mussels nor saffron for his birthday meal, Stan found a few scraps of leftover ham and tossed them into the pot with the vegetables. While they were simmering he sat down with his head in his hands, to think about what it meant to be an American--well, half American--orphan, alone in the city of Istanbul.Two facts presented themselves. First, that long dreamed-of day when his father would sober up, take him back to America and there make a new life for the two of them--that day, always unlikely, was now definitely never going to come. From that fact it followed that, second, there was never going to be the money to pay for his college, much less to indulge his dream of flying to the Gateway asteroid and its wondrous adventure. He wasn't ever going to become one of those colorful and heroic Gateway prospectors who flew to strange parts of the Galaxy. He wasn't going to discover a hoard of priceless artifacts left by the vanished old race of Heechee. And he wasn't going to become both famous and rich.Neither of these new facts was a total surprise to Stan. His faith in either had been steadily eroding since skepticism and the first dawn of puberty arrived simultaneously, when he wasthirteen. Still, they had seemed at least theoretically possible. Now, nothing seemed possible at all.That was when Stan at last allowed himself to cry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While Stan was drearily cleaning up the kitchen after his flavorless birthday meal, Mr. Ozden knocked on the door.Mr. Ozden was probably around seventy years old. To Stan he looked more like a hundred--a shriveled, ugly old man, hairless on the top of his head, but with his mustache still bristly black. He was the richest man Stan had ever met. He owned the ramshackle tenement where Stan lived, and the two others that flanked it, as well as the brothel that took up two floors of one of them. Mr. Ozden was a deeply religious man, so devout in his observances that he did not allow alcohol on his premises anywhere except in the brothel, and there only for the use of non-Islamic tourists. "My deepest sympathies to you on your loss, young Stanley," he boomed in his surprisingly loud voice, automatically scanning everything in sight for traces of a forbidden bottle of whiskey. (He never found any; Stan's father had been clever about that.) "It is a terrible tragedy, but we may not question the ways of God. What are your plans, may I ask?"Stan was already serving him tea, as his father always did. "I don't exactly know yet, Mr. Ozden. I guess I'll have to get a job.""Yes, that is so," Mr. Ozden agreed. He nibbled at a crumb of the macaroon Stan had put on a saucer for him, eyeing the boy. "Perhaps working at the consulate of the Americans, like your father?""Perhaps." Stan knew that wasn't going to happen, though. It had already been discussed. The Americans weren't going to hire any translator under the age of twenty-one."That would be excellent," Mr. Ozden announced. "Especially if it were to happen quickly. As you know, the rent is due tomorrow, in addition to last week's, which has not been paid, as well as the week's before. Would they pay you well at the consulate, do you think?""As God wills," Stan said, as piously as though he meant it.The old man nodded, studying Stan in a way that made the boy uneasy."Or," he said, with a smile that revealed his expensive teeth, "I could speak to my cousin for you, if you like."Stan sat up straight; Mr. Ozden's cousin was also his brothel keeper. "You mean to work for him? Doing what?""Doing what pays well," Mr. Ozden said severely. "You are young, and I believe in good health? You could have the luck to earn a considerable sum, I think."Something was churning, not pleasantly, in Stan's belly and groin. From time to time he had seen the whores in Mr. Ozden's cousin's employ as they sunned themselves on the rooftop when business was slow, often with one or two boys among them. The boys were generally even younger than himself, mostly Kurds or hill-country Anatolians, when they weren't from Algeria or Morocco. The boys didn't last long. Stan and his friend Tan had enjoyed calling insults at them from a distance. None of them had seemed very lucky.Before Stan could speak, Mr. Ozden was going on. "My cousin's clients are not only men, you know. Often women come to him, sometimes wealthy widows, tourists from Europe or the East, who are very grateful to a young man who can give them the pleasures their husbands can no longer supply. There are frequently large tips, of which my cousin allows his people to keep nearly half--in addition to providing his people with Term Medical as long as they are in his employ, as well as quite fine accommodations and meals, at reasonable rates. Quite often the women clients are not unattractive, also. Of course," he added, his voice speeding up and diminishing in volume, "naturally there would be men as well." He stood up, most of his tea and macaroon untouched. "But perhaps the consulate will make you a better offer. You should telephone them at once in any case, to let them know of your father's sad accident. It may even be that he has some uncollected salary still to his account which you can apply to the rent. I will come again in the morning."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When Stan called the consulate, Mr. Goodpastor wasn't in, but his elderly secretary was touched by the news. "Oh, Stanley! This terrible Wrath thing! How awful for you! Your father was a, uh, a very nice man." That part was only conditionally true, Stan knew. His father had been a sweet-natured, generous, unreliable drunk, and the only reason the consulate had given him any work at all was that he was an American who would work for the wages of a Turk. And when Stan asked diffidently if there was any chance of uncollected salary she was all tact. "I'm afraid not, Stanley. I handle all the vouchers for Mr. Goodpastor, you know. I'm sure there's nothing there. Actually," she added, sounding embarrassed, "I'm afraid it's more likely to be a little bit the other way. You see, your father had received several salary advances lately, so his account is somewhat overdrawn. But don't worry about that, dear. I'm sure no one will press a claim."The news was nothing Stan hadn't expected. All the same, it sharpened his problem. The Americans might not demand money from him, but Mr. Ozden certainly would. Already had. And would soon be doing his very best to collect. The last time someone had been evicted from one of his tenements Stan had been watching from the roof and had seen Mr. Ozden seizing every stick of their possessions to sell for the rent owed.Which made Stan look appraisingly around their tiny flat The major furnishings didn't matter, since they belonged to Mr. Ozden in the first place. Even the bed linens and the kitchenware were Ozden's. His father's skimpy wardrobe would certainly be taken. Stan's decrepit music player and his stacks of ancient American jazz recordings; his collection of space adventures, both anim� and morphed; his school books; the small amount of food on the shelves--put them all together and they would barely cover the rent. The only other things of measurable value were the musical instruments, his battered trumpet and the drums. Of course Mr. Ozden had no proper claim to the drums, since they weren't Stan's. They'd been brought there and left by his friend Tan Kusmeroglu, when Tan's parents wouldn't let them do any more music making in their house.That Stan could do something about. When he phoned Tan'shome it was Tan's mother who answered, and she began weeping as soon as she heard the news. It was a while before Mrs. Kusmeroglu could manage to tell Stan that Oltan wasn't home. He was at work, but she would get the sad message to him at once, and if there was anything they could do ... .When he got off the phone with Mrs. Kusmeroglu, Stan looked at the clock. He had plenty of time before he had to get to the morgue, so he opened up the couch he slept on--he wasn't quite ready to move into his father's bed--and lay down in case he needed to cry some more.He didn't, though. He fell asleep instantly, which was even better for him. What woke him, hours later, was Tan Kusmeroglu standing over him. Stan could hear the braying of the muezzin, calling the faithful to prayer from the little mosque around the corner, almost drowned out by Tan's excited voice as he shook Stan awake. "Come on, Stan, wake up! The old fart's at prayer now and I borrowed my boss's van. You'll never have a better time to get your stuff out!"That meant they had ten minutes at most. Stan didn't argue. It took less than that to load the drums, the trumpet, the precious music disks and player and a handful of other things into the van. They were already driving away before Stan remembered. "I have to go to the morgue," he said.Tan took his eyes from the tour bus that was weaving from side to side before them and the delivery truck that was trying to cut in from the side long enough to glance at Stan. His expression was peculiar--almost unTanly sympathetic, a little bit flushed in the way he always looked when about to propose some new escapade. "I have been thinking about that," he announced. "You don't want to go there.""But they want me to identify my father's body. I have to.""No, you don't. What's going to happen if you do? They're going to want you to pay for a funeral, and how are you going to do that? No. You stay out of sight."Stan asked simply, "Where?""With us, stupid! You can share my room. Or," he added, grinning, "you can share my sister's if you'd rather, only you would have to marry her first."IIIEverybody in the Kusmeroglu family worked. Mr. Kusmeroglu was a junior accountant in a factory that made Korean-brand cars for export. Tan delivered household appliances for a hardware store. His sixteen-year-old sister, Naslan, worked in the patisserie of one of the big hotels along the Bosphorus. Even Mrs. Kusmeroglu worked at home, assembling beads into bracelets that spelled out verses from the Koran, for the tourist trade--when she wasn't cleaning or cooking or mending the family's clothes. Even so, Stan knew without being told, they were barely making ends meet, with only the sketchiest of Basic Medical and a constant fear of the future. Going back to complete his schooling was now as hopelessly out of the question for Stan as it had been for Tan. So was sponging off the Kusmeroglus for any length of time.He had to find a way to make money.That wasn't easy. Stan couldn't get a regular job, even if there was one to be got, because under Turkish law he was now an unregistered nonperson. He wasn't the only one of that sort, of course. There were millions like him in poverty-stricken Istanbul. It wasn't likely the authorities would bother trying to track him down--unless he turned up on some official record.The good part was that the season was nearly summer. The city's normal population of 25 million, largely destitute, was being enriched each week by two or three million tourists, sometimes even more. These people, by definition, had money and nothing better to spend it on than Istanbul's sights, meals, curios and inhabitants. "You can become a guide," Mr. Kusmeroglu pronounced at dinner. "You speak both Turkish and English without flaw, Stanl...</p><h2>Cain&#39;s Jawbone: A Novel Problem</h2><p>In 1934, The Observer&#x2019;s crossword writer, Edward Powys Mathers, wrote a unique novel Cain&#x2019;s Jawbone.

The sixth edition was ready for print in 1842, but Hahnemann died before it could be printed. Just before the turn of the century, Drs William Boericke and James Wiffiam Ward paid $1,000 to purchase &#34;Organon&#34; from the Boenninghausen family. The sixth edition finally appeared in print in Germany in 1921 and in the United States in 1922. The edition was typeset around 80 years ago. The modern reader finds it difficult to read and go through the book. For the past few years the publishers has been constantly requested to reproduce this treasure in a manner which is consistent with modern books. To make the book user-friendly it has been refurnished. The positive changes we made are as follows: Footnotes which were earlier given at the bottom were difficult to find and read. In this new book, they have been incorporated into the main text at the intended places in brackets but in smaller fonts. This makes the reading and understanding of &#34;Organon&#34; easy and effortless. Lastly but very importantly a word index of 15 pages has been added by Dr S S Patil at the end of the book which makes it very easy to find the required portion of the text.</p><p></p><h2>Sweet Salt Air: A Novel</h2><p><p>On this island, hearts open under the summer stars and secrets float in the <b>sweet salt air </b>in this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel by Barbara Delinsky<i>...</i><br><i></i><br>Charlotte and Nicole were once the best of friends, spending summers together in Nicole's island house off of Maine.

With a year-round population of nearly three hundred, it was serviced by a daily mail boat that carried groceries and a handful of passengers, but no cars. Since Charlotte had one of those for the first time in her life, she proudly booked the ferry, boarding in Rockland on a Tuesday, which was one of only three days each week when its captain cruised past Vinalhaven to islands like Quinnipeague. Nicole had offered airfare to speed up the trip, but Charlotte flew everywhere else in life. This summer was to be different. <br>The car was an old Jeep Wrangler, bought from a friend of a friend for a fraction of its original cost. Giddy with excitement, she stashed the soft top in back, and, as the warm June air flowed freely through windows and roof, drove up from New York herself. She welcomed the time it would take. After a frantic two months of work to free herself up, she wanted to slow down, decompress, and maybe, just maybe figure out why she had agreed to a last summer on Quinnipeague. She had sworn she wouldn&#x2019;t return, had sworn off painful memories. <br>But there were good memories as well, all of which had flooded back as she read Nicole&#x2019;s e-mail in Ireland that day. She replied instantly, promising to phone as soon as she returned to New York. And she had. Literally. Right there in baggage claim while waiting for her duffel to come through. <br>Of course, she would come, she had told Nicole, only afterward doing the reasoning. For starters, there was Bob. She hadn&#x2019;t gone to his funeral because she hadn&#x2019;t had the courage to face even a dead Bob after letting him down&#x2014;letting them <i>all</i> down&#x2014;so badly. So she owed Nicole for the funeral, and owed her for the betrayal. <br>But obligation wasn&#x2019;t the only reason she had accepted the invitation. Relief was another; Nicole herself had suggested the collaboration. And nostalgia; Charlotte missed those carefree summers. And loneliness; she spent her life with people, but none were family as Nicole had once been. <br>And then there was the book. She had never worked on a book, had never actually collaborated on anything, though it sounded like a piece of cake, having someone else run the show. When she thought about the people she would interview, Cecily Cole came to mind first. Talk about compelling characters. Cecily <i>was</i> island cooking in many regards, since her herbs were what made the food special. She had to be the centerpiece of the book. Talking with her would be fun. <br>Charlotte could use a little fun, a little rest, a little make-believe&#x2014;and Quinnipeague was the place for that. Even now, as the ferry passed in and out of fog, reality came and went. <i>You can&#x2019;t go home again,</i> Thomas Wolfe had written, and she prayed he was wrong. She expected some awkwardness; ten years and very different lives later, she and Nicole couldn&#x2019;t just pick up where they&#x2019;d left off. Moreover, if Nicole knew of her betrayal, all bets were off. <br>But if Nicole knew, she wouldn&#x2019;t have asked Charlotte to come. Nicole Carlysle didn&#x2019;t have a devious bone in her body. <br>Leaning out from the side railing, she caught a breath. There it <i>was</i>&#x2014; <br>But no, just an ocean mirage quickly swallowed by the fog. <br>After moving past empty benches, she held tightly to the front rail. Anticipation had built since leaving New York, accelerating in leaps after New Haven, then Boston. By the time she passed Portland, impatience had her regretting the decision to drive, but that changed once she left the highway at Brunswick and started up the coast. Bath, Wiscasset, Damariscotta&#x2014;she loved the names as much as the occasional view of boats, seaside homes, roadside stands. FULL BELLY CLAMS one sign read, but she resisted. Clams served on Quinnipeague were dug from the flats hours before cooking, and the batter, which was exquisitely light, held bits of parsley and thyme. Other fried clams couldn&#x2019;t compare. <br>The ferry rose on a swell, but plowed steadily on. Though the air was cool and the wind sharpened by bits of spray, she couldn&#x2019;t get herself to go inside. She had put on a sweater over her jeans when the ferry left Rockland, and while she had also tied back her hair, loose tendrils blew free. They whipped behind her now as she kept her eyes on the sea. Some called North Atlantic waters cold and forbidding, but she had seen others. Turquoise, emerald, teal&#x2014;none moved her as gray-blue did. Seventeen summers here had made it a visceral thing. <br>Her camera. She needed to capture this. <br>But no. She didn&#x2019;t want anything coming between her eyes and that first sighting. <br>Having relived it dozens of times in the preceding weeks, she thought she was prepared, but the thrill when the island finally emerged from the mist was something else. One by one, as the fog thinned, the features she remembered sharpened: jagged outcroppings of rock, a corona of trees, the Chowder House perched on granite and flanked by twin roads that swung wide for a gentle descent from town to pier, like symmetrical stairways in an elegant home. <br>That said, there was nothing elegant about Quinnipeague, with its rutted paths and weathered docks. But Quinnipeague wasn&#x2019;t meant to be elegant. It was meant to be authentic. Shutters were practical things to be closed in the fiercest of winds, and, when open, hung crooked more often than not. Wood was gray, clusters of buoys tacked to the side of the fishing shed were bright despite their chipping paint, and the gulls that swooped in to perch on tall pilings always left their chalky mark. <br>Sailboats grew distinct from power ones as the ferry neared. There were fewer lobster boats than Charlotte remembered, fewer lobstermen she had read, though those who remained would be out pulling traps this Tuesday, hence moorings with only dinghies attached. <br>Her pulse sped when she saw a figure running down the pier, and in that instant, the bad of the past blew right back out to sea. She waved frantically. <i>&#x201c;Nicki! I&#x2019;m here&#x2014;here, Nicki!&#x201d;</i> <br>Like there were other people on the ferry. Like Nicole could possibly miss her. Like Nicole could even <i>hear</i> her over the thrum of the boat and the slap of waves on pilings. But Charlotte couldn&#x2019;t help herself. She was a child again, having traveled alone from Virginia with her heart in her mouth and here, finally, so relieved to have reached the right place. She was a teenager, a seasoned flier now from Texas, electrified by the sight of her best friend. She was a college student who had taken the bus up from New Haven to summer with a family that wanted to hear about her courses, her friends, her dreams. <br>For all the places she&#x2019;d been in the ten years since that wedding summer, no one had ever been waiting for her. <br>In that moment, seeing Nicole bubbling with excitement on the pier, her own relief was so great that she forgave her the timidity, the docility, the sheer agreeableness that had made her such easy prey for betrayal&#x2014;traits Charlotte had seized on over the years to forgive her own behavior. <br>But this was a new day. The hovering fog couldn&#x2019;t dull the reds and blues of the boats. Nor could the smell of seaweed overpower that of the Chowder House grill. Bobbing on her toes, she clutched her hands at her mouth to contain herself, while with agonizing precision and a grinding of gears, the ferry slowed and began to turn. She moved along the side to keep the pier front and center in her sight. <br>Beautiful Nicole. That hadn&#x2019;t changed. Always petite, she looked positively willowy standing there on the pier. Always stylish, she was even more so now in her skinny jeans and leather jacket. The wind whipped her scarf, which likely cost more than Charlotte&#x2019;s entire summer wardrobe&#x2014;the latter being vintage L. L. Bean, emphasis on <i>vintage,</i> having traveled with Charlotte for years. Style had never been in her lexicon. The closest she came to it now were her flats, bought three years before at an open-air market in Paris. <br>Chug by chug, the ferry backed its snub stern to the end of the dock. The instant the captain released the chains and lowered the ramp, Charlotte was off and running. Throwing her arms around Nicole, she cried, &#x201c;You are the best sight ever! You look amazing!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And <i>you,</i>&#x201d; Nicole cried back, clinging tightly. Her body shook. She was crying. <br>Charlotte might have cried, too, her throat was that tight. Ten years and such different lives, yet Nicole was as excited as she was. Grasping at everything that had been so right about their summers together, she just held on, swaying for another few seconds until Nicole laughed through her tears and drew back. Running her fingers under her eyes, she explored Charlotte&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You have not changed a bit,&#x201d; she declared in the voice Charlotte remembered&#x2014;high, not quite childlike but close. &#x201c;And I still love your hair.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same old mess, but I love yours. You <i>cut</i> it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just last month, finally. I mean, I may still sound like I did when I was ten, but I wanted to <i>look</i> like an adult at least.&#x201d; Blond and straight, her hair had always fallen to midback. Cut now in a wedge, it was shaped neatly around her face in a way that gave focus to the green of her eyes, which were luminous with lingering tears and suddenly anxious. &#x201c;Was the trip okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It was fine&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But it was long, and you&#x2019;re not used to driving&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Which was why I wanted to do it, and it was good, it really was&#x2014;and for the record, Nicki, you always looked gorgeous, but this cut is very, very cool.&#x201d; By comparison, Charlotte might have felt unsophisticated, if she hadn&#x2019;t known that women paid big bucks for hair like hers, and as for her voice, which was neither high nor distinct, it got her where she needed to be. <br>Nicole was eyeing her shoes. &#x201c; <i>Love</i> those. Paris?&#x201d; <br>Charlotte grinned. &#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And your sweater? Not Paris, but fabulous. So <i>authentic</i>.&#x201d; Her voice grew urgent. &#x201c;Where did you get it? I need one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, sweetie. It&#x2019;s a hand-me-down from a woman in Ireland.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>So</i> perfect for this place. It&#x2019;s been a dismal, cloudy June. I should have warned you, but I was afraid you wouldn&#x2019;t come.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve survived dismal and cloudy before.&#x201d; She glanced up the hill. &#x201c;The island looks just the same.&#x201d; Past the Chowder House were the general store left and the post office right, both buildings long and low so as not to tempt the wind. &#x201c;Like nothing&#x2019;s changed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Little has. But we do have Wi-Fi at the house. Got it set up last week.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;For just us two?&#x201d; she asked to be sure. Nicole had initially told her that Julian would be up with her the week before, but was planning to leave before Charlotte arrived. If he had decided to stay on, it would change the tenor of her visit, putting the fragility of her relationship with Nicole front and center. <br>But Nicole was all cool confidence. &#x201c;Hey. We deserve it. Besides, if I don&#x2019;t keep blogging, people will lose interest and wander away, and then there won&#x2019;t be as many to hear me when I start pitching our book&#x2014;which I feel a hundred percent better doing now that you&#x2019;ve agreed to help. Thank you, Charlotte,&#x201d; she said earnestly. &#x201c;I know you have more important things to do.&#x201d; <br>Charlotte might have insisted that this was as important a project as she&#x2019;d done in a while, if a gruff call hadn&#x2019;t cut off the thought. <br>&#x201c;Hellooo.&#x201d; The ferry captain shot a thumb at her Jeep. &#x201c;Gonna get it off?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Releasing Nicole, she ran back onto the ferry and slid behind the wheel. By the time she revved the engine, Nicole was in the passenger&#x2019;s seat, sliding a hand over the timeworn dashboard. &#x201c;I am paying you for this.&#x201d; <br>Charlotte shot her a startled look and inched forward. &#x201c;For this car? You are not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t have bought it if it weren&#x2019;t for my book, and you won&#x2019;t take money for that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s <i>your</i> book. I&#x2019;m just along for the ride.&#x201d; She laughed at her own words. &#x201c;Can you believe, this is the first car I&#x2019;ve ever owned?&#x201d; She eased it onto the dock. &#x201c;Is it real or what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Totally</i> real,&#x201d; Nicole said, though momentarily wary. &#x201c;Safe on the highway?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It got me here.&#x201d; Charlotte waved at the captain. &#x201c;Thank you!&#x201d; Still crawling along, she drove carefully off the pier. When she was on firm ground, she stopped, angled sideways in the seat, and addressed the first of the ghosts. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about your dad, Nicki. I wanted to be there. I just couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>Seeming suddenly older, Nicole smiled sadly. &#x201c;You were probably better off. There were people all over the place. I didn&#x2019;t have time to think.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A heart attack?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Massive.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No history of heart problems?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s scary. How&#x2019;s Angie?&#x201d; Nicole&#x2019;s mother. Charlotte had phoned her, too, and though Angie had said all the right words&#x2014; <i>Yes, a tragedy, he loved you, too, you&#x2019;re a darling to call</i>&#x2014;she had sounded distracted. <br>&#x201c;Bad,&#x201d; Nicole confirmed. &#x201c;They were so in love. And he loved Quinnipeague. His parents bought the house when he was little. He actually proposed to Mom here. They always said that if I&#x2019;d been a boy, they&#x2019;d have named me Quinn. She can&#x2019;t bear to come now. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s selling. She can&#x2019;t even come to pack up. This place was so him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Woo-hoo,&#x201d; came a holler that instantly lifted the mood. &#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; A stocky woman, whose apron covered a T-shirt and shorts, was trotting down the stairs from the lower deck of the Chowder House. Dorey Jewett had taken over from her father midway through Charlotte&#x2019;s summers here and had brought the place up to par with the best of city restaurants. She had the gleaming skin of one who worked over steam, but the creases by her eyes, as much from smiling as from squinting over the harbor, suggested she was nearing sixty. &#x201c;Missy here said you were coming, but just look at you. All grown up.&#x201d; <br>A lifelong Mainer, she talked the part. Loving that, Charlotte laughed. &#x201c;I was twenty-four when I was here last, no child then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But <i>look</i> at you. That&#x2019;s some sweater!&#x201d; The sheer ebullience of the woman made Charlotte laugh again. &#x201c;And Missy? Well, I&#x2019;ve seen her these last years, but I tell you, the two a&#x2019; you put the rest of us to shame.&#x201d; Her brows went up. &#x201c;You hungry? Chowder&#x2019;s hot.&#x201d; <br> <i>Chowdah,</i> Charlotte thought happily. It was late afternoon, and she was starved. But Nicole loved to cook, and Nicole was calling the shots. <br>Leaning across the stick shift, Nicole told Dorey, &#x201c;To go, please, with corn bread and fiddleheads.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be taking the last a&#x2019; those,&#x201d; Dorey confided. &#x201c;I had a vendor try to convince me to shrink-wrap and freeze, but they&#x2019;re never the same. I only have &#x2019;em now because they&#x2019;re from up north&#x201d;&#x2014; <i>nauth</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;and the growing season was late this year. They&#x2019;d have been gone a week ago, if business hadn&#x2019;t been slow, but the price a&#x2019; gas is so high, and no one&#x2019;s out day-cruisin&#x2019; anyways when the wind&#x2019;s so mean. Think you can tough out the chill?&#x201d; she asked, seeming impervious to it herself with her bare arms and legs. <br>But Charlotte was still focused on hunger. &#x201c;Maybe a couple of clams, too?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You got &#x2019;em. Drive up top. I&#x2019;ll bring &#x2019;em out.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Barbara Delinsky <br></p><h2>Blink. The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking</h2><p>In his landmark bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren&#39;t as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize</p><p><i>Blink</i> is about the first two seconds of looking--the decisive glance that knows in an instant. Gladwell, the best-selling author of <i>The Tipping Point</i>, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of "thin slices" of behavior. The key is to rely on our "adaptive unconscious"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <p> Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us "mind blind," focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to "the Warren Harding Effect" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the "dark side of blink," he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. In this brilliant, cage-rattling book, one can only wish for a thicker slice of Gladwell's ideas about what Blink Camp might look like. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Malcolm Gladwell has been a staff writer with the New Yorker since 1996.

With her fifth novel, Scottoline breaks new ground in fiction's hottest genre and launches a riveting series featuring the adventures of an all-woman law firm. No one but a Scottoline could write this series. <p>As <em> Rough Justice </em> opens, criminal lawyer Marta Richter is only hours away from winning an acquittal on a murder charge leveled against her client, millionaire businessman Elliot Steere. But as the jury begins to deliberate, Steere lets it slip that he sold Marta a bogus self-defense claim and that he in fact murdered the homeless man who tried to carjack him. Infuriated, Marta sets out to find evidence that will convict Steere -- before the jury returns with its verdict. </p> <p>Marta has her hands full; she's playing beat-the-clock with both the jury and the worst blizzard Philadelphians have seen in decades.

Even from his jail cell, the businessman has the cunning and connections to kill again. The lawyers have finally met their match in Elliot Steere.

President Roosevelt was faced with a difficult decision: stop all professional baseball for the good of the victory, but in doing so, risk losing a vital part of morale. He decided that, whatever it took, <b>The Game Must Go On</b>. <br> &nbsp;<br> This is the story of American baseball during World War II - of both the players who left to join the war and the ones who struggled to keep the game alive on the home front. Taking the place of the big shots turned soldiers, sailors and combat pilots were misfit replacement players. While Greenberg represented the player who served, Pete Gray symbolized the player who stayed. He was a one-armed outfielder who overcame insurmountable odds to become a professional. <br> &nbsp;<br> John Klima drops us straight into 1941 to 1945. Culminating in the 1945 pennace race, where Greenberg and Gray's paths memorably crossed, Klima's story shows us how World War II made the country come of age and took baseball with it. This is the story of how the games we play changed because of the battles we fought.&nbsp;</p><p>John Klima is the author of four books, including <b>The Game Must Go On</b> (2015), <b>Bushville Wins </b>(2012) and <b>Willie's Boys </b>(2009).

Reprint.</p><p>Long poem by T.S. Eliot, published in 1922, first in London in The Criterion (October), next in New York City in The Dial (November), and finally in book form, with footnotes by Eliot. The 433-line, five-part poem was dedicated to fellow poet Ezra Pound, who helped condense the original manuscript to nearly half its size. It was one of the most influential works of the 20th century. The Waste Land expresses with great power the disillusionment and disgust of the period after World War I. In a series of fragmentary vignettes, loosely linked by the legend of the search for the Grail, it portrays a sterile world of panicky fears and barren lusts, and of human beings waiting for some sign or promise of redemption. The depiction of spiritual emptiness in the secularized city--the decay of urbs aeterna (the "eternal city")--is not a simple contrast of the heroic past with the degraded present; it is rather a timeless, simultaneous awareness of moral grandeur and moral evil. The poem initially met with controversy as its complex and erudite style was alternately denounced for its obscurity and praised for its modernism. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i>Written when Eliot was working as a bank clerk and heavily edited by his friend Ezra Pound, 1922's The Waste Land could probably take the prize as the most important English-language poem of the 20th century. This 75th-anniversary edition includes the full text plus notes and an afterword by scholar/editor Christopher Ricks.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heartbreak Bronco (Phantom Stallion, No. 13)</h2><p><p>For the Phantom, there is only one girl.

Four chapters, one for each designer, are full of their most elegant, dynamic and popular cross stitch creations. Barbara&#39;s gorgeous florals, Sandy&#39;s intricate samplers, Linda&#39;s charming wildlife and Nancy&#39;s seasonal landscapes are well recognized and collected by discerning stitchers. This book brings them all together for the first time to create a treasure trove of designs within its 208 pages.</p><p>Linda Gillum, Barbara Baatz Hillman, Sandy Orton, and Nancy Rossi are all staff designers with Kooler Design Studio, a California-based company of multi-talented illustrators, craft designers, editors, project managers, graphic artists, design assistants and photographers. Their work appears in magazines, hardcover and softcover books, leaflets, CDs, and kits. Founded in 1985 by Donna Kooler and now led by her daughter Basha Kooler as president, the group has a web site at www.koolerdesign.com.Don't let the cover (a dizzying close-up of a giant, man-eating, pink-toned peony blossom) dissuade you from diving into this impressive collection of 38 counted cross stitch designs by four needleworkers. Each has her own style and presents a candy store of patterns in varying degrees of difficulty for a range of talents. Gillum, a founding partner in Kooler Design Studio in California, offers fish, cats and a patriotic carousel horse. Hillman's designs include a kimono and a Celtic angel (green with pink and orange accents) along with ones of fruits and flowers, dotted with her signature dew drop. Orton's designs extend from time-consuming projects ("Nature's Wisdom") to bookmarks that can be stitched in a week. Rossi, with the studio since its founding in 1985, concentrates on still-lifes from nature; "Moonlit Cranes" is as compelling as traditional art. Brief instructions, not for the absolute newbie embroiderer, are general enough to help most cross stitchers, who will find finishing directions for the bookmarks especially helpful. Patterns are clear and color-coded.<p></p><p> - Publisher's Weekly: 09/09/2011</p></p><h2>Swing, Swagger, Drape: Knit the Colors of Australia</h2><p><p>A long-awaited collection of 30 designs by Australia&#x2019;s leading knitwear designer is showcased in this instructional knitting handbook utilizing classic yarns, which features on-location photography of the Australian flora and fauna that inspired her work. Small projects with step-by-step instructions introduce the techniques used in the garments, such as intarsia, miters, and textured patterns. Designer notes explain the logic of the shapes and highlight opportunities for customizing the fit. Alternate colorways are also&nbsp;shown for most garments along with distinctive shapes for jackets, coats, and simple wraps that flatter and fit. </p></p><p><strong>Jane Slicer-Smith is a knitter, a teacher, and the author of <i>Signature Handknits</i>. Her work has been displayed in various knitting magazines, such as <i>Interweave</i>, <i>Knitters</i>, and <i>Vogue Knitting</i>.<strong> Alexis Xenakis is the publisher of <i>Knitter's Magazine</i> and XRX Books. His photography is featured in more than 32 books, including all three volumes of The Knitting Experience series. He lives in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. </strong></strong>A "wow" from start to finish, Swing Swagger Drape is filled with garments that are not only exciting and different, but very wearable and flattering. Each one has both visual complexity and body-friendly shaping. We can happily accept the author's invitation to "step into my world of color". Australia provides the setting for photographer Alexis Xenakis's lush images and is a source of inspiration to the author, whose design skills and eye for detail are evident on each page and in every project. There are plenty of options for each pattern, including a variety of lengths and color combinations. Also packed into the pages are tips for achieving the right fit, mixing and matching textures, making Polyform clay buttons, and more. It's a wonderful mix of techniques, such as intarsia, drop stitch, and miters. Motivated advanced-beginners will be able to tackle most of the projects, but there are plenty of challenges for seasoned knitters. Special favorites include the Metro Coat worked in Intarsia with cables, shown with a choice of three lengths and a trio of panel options (solid, color block, or strips and bobble accents). The way the tree climbs the sleeve of The Deco Drape &amp; Jacket and then turns into an abstract graphic is sublime. Go straight to page 55 to see the irresistible Miter Vee, which is a drape that will make you crave winter. A section called "Process &amp; Practice" in the back of the book will help you get started. It includes four simple projects as well as basic techniques and yarn specs. Don't miss the colophon on the final pages with more beautiful photos and the author's story.-www.knittinguniverse.com Wow, transport yourself to Australia with this collection of tremendous knits. I like most of the knits in this book. Jane has gone out there, researched, brought her own style and shape to knitting and it works. She is my number one favourite knitwear designer of the moment. Another thing I love about this book is the design of it, the layout and photography set this book apart from any other I have seen recently. It really is wow! (that's why I've said that twice). The collection includes knits for men, women and children including bags and hats, but the essence is on style, fit and looking great. Patterns include simple stitching for beginners to complex challenging shaping for the experienced. Some of the colourways don't quite work for me, but hey this is almost knitting perfection.-KarenPlatt.co.uk The subtitle of this remarkable book is "Knit the colors of Australia" and if you still harbor any opinions about knitting being for old ladies in rocking chairs, you need to see it. From the glorious coat on the front to all the garments within, this is a book for the modern knitter. I tend to be suspicious of coffee table books with their large format, glossy photographs and lush colors but this one has all of that with none of the usual minus points. It is simply a book of patterns that looks good. It is actually more awash with instructions, charts, diagrams and patterns than photographs although there are plenty of these to show what the finished article looks like. This is not a beginners' book in any sense, more aimed at intermediate and advanced knitters who want a nice big challenging project that looks impressive and is practical. There are garments for men as well as women in here, and you can find coats, cardigans, sweaters, hats, gilets and wraps. The projects are organised into sections, dealing with intarsia, textures and miters but the best way to find what you want is to look at everything; the headings tend to be more about the author's creative journey which gives the book its unique style. You can also find, at the back of the book instructions on making polymer clay buttons, getting the perfect fit and various other aspects of the earlier patterns too such as understanding intarsia. There is also a lovely section on the author's home city of Sydney and various other places where the photographs were shot on location. This book has a great Aussie style about it, from the colors and textures used to the exuberant sense of style and general joie de vivre. If I see a lovelier craft book this year I will be very lucky - one for the keeper shelf.-Myshelf.com</p><h2>Sofia the First</h2><p><br>Meet Sofia, a little girl who lives a rather ordinary life.

However, in 1897 he was employed as a designer by James Macintyre &amp; Co., a large Staffordshire earthenware manufacturer interested in expanding their production of art pottery. Building on the slipware techniques already established at Macintyre's, Moorcroft was able to develop a decorative style. With its raised slip decoration in floral and Art Nouveau forms, Moorcroft's Florian Ware was quickly successful, and by 1905 was being sold by major stores in London, Paris and New York. Popularity was underlined by success at international exhibitions, with Moorcroft winning his first Gold Medal at St Louis in 1904.<br>In 1913 Moorcroft left Macintyre's to set up his own pottery in a custom-built works nearby. New designs appeared, maintaining his reputation for colourful and delicate interpretations of natural forms and landscape. The famous powder blue tableware range, described as 'undatedly perfect' was introduced, and Moorcroft continued to enjoy international success. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s designs were evolved to suit the changing tastes, with Moorcroft wares matching both the bright abstraction of the Jazz Age and the cooler, more austere style of Art Deco. Having survived the Second World War largely on the strength of its export business, the Moorcroft pottery was taken over by William's son Walter in 1945, following his father's sudden death.<br>Today, W. Moorcroft PLC is still an independent business, with William's younger son John in charge, Walter having retired in 1987. The method of production developed by William in 1897 is unchanged, but the pattern range has recently been expanded by the designer Sally Tuffin.<br>The great interest in Moorcroft pottery today was initially generated by two exhibitions of the early 1970s, one held at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, and the other organised by Richard Dennis. The catalogue for the latter, the first to study the history of Moorcroft in any depth, was expanded in 1987 into the first edition of this book.</p><p>Paul Atterbury is a long-time expert on BBC TV&#39;s &#34;Antiques Roadshow&#34;.

I&#x2019;d not want the Christmas dinner to be spoiled."</p><p>Her employer, Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly, said over his shoulder, "We&#x2019;ll be on time, I promise, Kinky." He strode off accompanied by his guest, Caitlin "Kitty" O&#x2019;Hallorhan, and his young assistant, Doctor Barry Laverty.</p><p>Kinky shut the front door after them. She imagined that over the excited voices of the children she could hear footsteps crunching through the freshly fallen snow as Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly led his little party to his big old Rover for the drive to Ballybucklebo House and the marquis&#x2019; 1964 Christmas Day open house.</p><p>It was warmer in the hall with the door shut. Just as well with a dozen chilled little carollers inside drinking hot black-currant juice. She straightened up, inspected her handiwork, and smiled. "There you are, Dermot Fogarty. Good as new, so."</p><p>"Thank youse, Mrs. Kincaid." The eight-year-old bobbed his head. "If I&#x2019;d got my new coat dirty, my daddy would&#x2019;ve killed me, so he would."</p><p>She tousled his hair. Not for the first time she thought how harsh to her ears the County Down accent sounded, especially when she remembered the softer brogue of her own people down in County Cork.</p><p>She&#x2019;d grown up there on a farm near Beal na mBl�th and had left as a slip of a girl of nineteen to come north in 1928. That had been thirty-six years ago. She shook her head. It seemed like no time at all.</p><p>"Here." She refilled Dermot&#x2019;s mug, feeling the heat in the delft and inhaling the scent of the black-currant juice. "Try not to spill any more."</p><p>"Thank you, Mrs. Kincaid."</p><p>"Anyone else?"</p><p>Several voices replied, "No thank you, Mrs. Kincaid."</p><p>The kiddies were crammed into the hall and overflowing up the broad staircase of Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s house at Number 1 Main Street, Ballybucklebo, County Down.</p><p>"Then eat up, and drink up, and let&#x2019;s be having a bit of hush." They were quiet now, filling their faces with Kinky&#x2019;s homemade sweet mince pies and hot juice. She beamed over them. She liked children, would have loved to have had some of her own, but that hadn&#x2019;t been meant to be. She smiled sadly to herself.</p><p>She probably could have found another fellah here in Ulster, but och, he&#x2019;d not have been the Paudeen Kincaid she lost so long ago. She saw herself in the hall mirror and thought she&#x2019;d not been a bad-looking lass when she&#x2019;d been with Paudeen. Her silver hair, which she wore in a chignon now, was chestnut then and had flowed in soft waves to her shoulders. It was the worry about him one Saint Stephen&#x2019;s Day that had started the turning of it.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been a slim girl then. Now, she knew she could afford to lose a couple of stone, although doing so wouldn&#x2019;t get rid of her three chins. But it was hard not to sample her own cooking, and she did love to cook. She always had, ever since Ma had showed her how all those years ago.</p><p>She shook her head, and sure if the years had passed, hadn&#x2019;t they been good ones ever since she&#x2019;d come here, first as house keeper to old Doctor Flanagan and later on, in 1946, to Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly when he took over the practice? And hadn&#x2019;t looking after those two bachelor men been a satisfying job, and almost the same as rearing chisellers?</p><p>Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly, learned man that he was, would not get out of the house without egg stains on his tie if she wasn&#x2019;t there to sponge them off or make him change it. He often called his Labrador, Arthur Guinness, a great lummox. Sometimes, she thought with affection, the pot does call the kettle black.</p><p>"Pleath, Mithis Kincaid?" A child&#x2019;s voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>She saw Billy Cadogan, a boy who suffered from asthma. He&#x2019;d been a patient of the practice since Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly and Miss Hagerty, the midwife, had delivered him ten years ago. "Yes, Billy?" He looked smart in what must be his brand-new cap and bright red mittens.</p><p>He held up his mug. "Pleath, Mithis Kincaid, can I have a toty wee taste more? Ith cold thinging carolth round the houtheth today, tho it ith."</p><p>So, she thought, she should have known that Billy was the one lisping when they sang "We Wish You a Merry Christmas."</p><p>Before she could answer, Colin Brown chipped in, "Billy&#x2019;s right; it would found er you." Even today he was wearing short pants. His bare knees stuck out from under his overcoat, and his left sock was crumpled around his ankle. Colin was the lad who had single-handedly, as the innkeeper at the recent Nativity play, caused the mother superior to faint. Colin spoke again. "My Da says it&#x2019;s as cold as a witch&#x2019;s tit today, so he does."</p><p>Kinky frowned, then seeing the seriousness on the boy&#x2019;s face, realized that he was merely repeating what he had heard his notoriously foul-mouthed father say. "And what would you know of witches, Colin Brown?" she asked.</p><p>"Oooh," said Colin, "witches is oul&#x2019; wizenedy women with wrinkles and warts on their green faces. They have black cats, they wear pointy hats and black dresses, ride around on broomsticks on Halloween night . . . they cast spells, and . . ."&#x2014;he frowned&#x2014;"and . . ." Then a smile split his face and his words came out in a rush. "And they get together in ovens."</p><p>"Colin means &#x2018;covens.&#x2019; " That was Hazel Arbuthnot. She was Aggie Arbuthnot&#x2019;s twelve-year-old daughter. She had lustrous black hair, just like her mother. For a moment, Kinky wondered if Hazel had also inherited the family trait of six toes. No doubt Cissie Sloan, Aggie&#x2019;s cousin and the most talkative woman in the village, would know.</p><p>"That&#x2019;s right, Hazel, covens." Kinky heard the other children laughing at Colin&#x2019;s discomfiture. "And there&#x2019;s no need to laugh at Colin. He nearly got it right."</p><p>The giggling subsided.</p><p>"And some witches do cast evil spells and sour the milk, or make the crops fail or animals die&#x2014;"</p><p>"Oooh." Several voices were raised, and Kinky heard sharp in-drawings of breath.</p><p>"&#x2014;but some are good witches." She paused to let that sink in.</p><p>"Good witches?" Eddie Jingles asked. He&#x2019;d had pneumonia two weeks before Christmas. He was better now, but his mother, Jeannie, had very sensibly wrapped him up in boots, thick trousers, a heavy anorak, a green scarf, and a blue-and-white-striped wool toque. "I never knew there was good witches. Are you having us on, Mrs. Kincaid?"</p><p>Kinky scowled at him, then let a smile play at the corners of her mouth. "Why would you think I was making it up, Eddie Jingles?"</p><p>Eddie blushed and lowered his head. "Sorry."</p><p>"Now," she said, "how many of you believe there are good witches? Hold up your hands."</p><p>Jeannie Kennedy&#x2019;s hand was the first to go up, then Micky Corry&#x2019;s. Those two had been Mary and Joseph in the Christmas pageant earlier that week. The last hand raised was Colin Brown&#x2019;s, but Kinky had expected that. Colin had a mind of his own.</p><p>"Good. So we&#x2019;re all in agreement then?"</p><p>"Yes, Mrs. Kincaid," a chorus of voices replied.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m glad to hear it." She lowered her voice and let her gaze wander over the group, looking this one, then that one, right in the eye. "Because my own mother was a good witch, so. My very own mother, and she got it from her mother, my granny."</p><p>"Does that make you a witch too, Mrs. Kincaid . . . since your mammy was one?" Colin had his head cocked to one side, his eyes narrowed. "You&#x2019;ve no warts on your nose, like."</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t be impudent, Colin Brown." She put her face closer to his, flared her nostrils, and widened her eyes. "Or I&#x2019;ll turn you into a tooooadstool."</p><p>The communal "oooh" was much louder.</p><p>Seeing the look on Colin&#x2019;s face, Kinky softened. "I&#x2019;m only pulling your leg, son, so, for I&#x2019;m not a witch at all. I couldn&#x2019;t turn you into anything." Even if I did get the sight to see the future from my mother, Kinky thought, but that&#x2019;s none of their business. "And if I was . . . if . . . I&#x2019;d be a good witch and lift spells or smell out bad witches or cure people with herbs or find water wells&#x2014;"</p><p>"With a hazel twig?" Billy Cadogan interrupted.</p><p>"Or a Hazel Arbuthnot," Colin said, then sniggered and stuck his tongue out at Hazel.</p><p>"Less of that, Colin, or I&#x2019;ll not tell you any more," Kinky said.</p><p>"Sorry," Colin said. "I&#x2019;ll houl&#x2019; my wheest. Honest."</p><p>"You do that, so," said Kinky. She let a silence hang, and hang, until Hazel said, "Pay him no heed, Mrs. Kincaid. He was just acting the lig. I don&#x2019;t mind. Go on, please tell us more."</p><p>Several other children added, "Please . . . please."</p><p>Kinky smiled. The sight wasn&#x2019;t the only thing she&#x2019;d got from her family, and that was a story in itself. Her Da, God rest him, had been a famous seanachie, a storyteller, and Kinky Kincaid, when given an audience, liked nothing better than to spin a good yarn.</p><p>"So, it&#x2019;s a story you want?"</p><p>"Please." She saw the expectation on the rosy-cheeked faces.</p><p>"Very well," she said. "Take off your hats and coats and hang them there, now." She indicated the hall coat stand. "Then go on up to the lounge. The fire&#x2019;s still lit from this morning, and it&#x2019;s warm. Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly won&#x2019;t mind, seeing it&#x2019;s Christmas Day. There aren&#x2019;t enough chairs for you all, so some will have to sit on the floor. Mind you&#x2019;re careful with your mugs of juice as you go up the stairs, now. Leave a chair for me, and don&#x2019;t be annoying the animals. Arthur Guinness and Lady Macbeth do be upstairs."</p><p>The hall was filled with a babel of excited voices as the children struggled out of their outer clothes.</p><p>"Now hush. Hush." Kinky had to raise her voice. "Do as I bid," she said. "I&#x2019;ll be up in a shmall little minute with more mince pies."</p><p>"Yo-o-o-oh."</p><p>She waited for quiet. "And then I&#x2019;ll tell you a story of faeries, and the banshee, and the Saint Stephen&#x2019;s Day Ghost, and if we&#x2019;ve time&#x2014;but remember I&#x2019;ve a dinner to cook, so only if we&#x2019;ve time&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll tell you how the Saint Stephen&#x2019;s Day Ghost came back four years later."</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from An Irish Country Girl by Patrick Taylor.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Patrick Taylor.<br>Published in 2009 by A Tom Doherty Associates Book.<br>All rights reserved.

A world without all the jaw clenching, nail biting, and stress-induced melt downs? Eighty percent of health problems today are due to the downstream effects of stress, so learning to break free from stress could dramatically improve your mood, your relationships, your health&#x2013;&#x2013;and your life. In Wired for Joy, researcher and New York Times&#x2013;bestselling author Laurel Mellin presents a simple yet proven way to train your brain to move through stress and back to joy. Her method has been called the missing link in health care, as it focuses on rewiring the emotional brain&#x2014;the caldron of our stress&#x2014;rather than the thinking brain, which has been the focus of most other stress-busting methods.Based on the cutting-edge science of neuroplasticity, Mellin outlines the five states of the emotional brain. For each state she presents a specific tool that easily and quickly switches the brain back to a state of well-being. Once you know how to make that switch, life becomes easier, and stress symptoms&#x2014;depression, anxiety, overeating, high blood pressure&#x2014;tend to fade. Finally, instead of focusing on the symptoms of stress, we can change the wiring that triggers it and experience new sense of freedom in our lives.</p><p>Laurel Mellin, author of the New York Times&#x2013;bestseller The Pathway, is an associate clinical professor of family and community medicine and pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. She is the founder of emotional brain training (EBT) a method that focuses on alleviating stress to promote high-level well-being. Mellin has been involved in a variety of research and teaching roles and has received awards from the American Medical Association, the American Bariatric Society, and the U.S. Department of Consumer Education. Her research has been featured in Fortune magazine, U.S. News &amp; World Report, and Time and has appeared on Oprah, Good Morning America, Today, and The Early Show."So many authors today promise to bring joy to your life, help you lose weight, or inspire you to overcome addictions using a magical method that turns out to be completely inapplicable. But Wired for Joy is the real deal! With inspiring anecdotes about real people, clear language, and lovely diagrams, Wired for Joy delivers a technology&#x2014;based on more than 30 years of research&#x2014;that can lift us from the stressed-out state to the natural state of pure joy, where the need for the fixes of food, drink, drugs, and workaholism melt away. I am heartily recommending this book to everyone&#x2014;this is the one book to read if you have no time to read!"<br>&#x2014; Candace B. Pert, Ph.D., best-selling author of Molecules of Emotion and Everything You Need to Know to Feel Go(o)d</p><h2>Moorish Spain</h2><p>In the year 711, a small Berber army under Arab leadership crossed the Straits of Gibraltar from Morocco and, in the following year, defeated the army of Spain, slaying its king. Within a matter of a few years only, the whole of the Iberian peninsula was theirs and the course of Western civilization was transformed.<br>For nearly a thousand years, the Islamic presence they planted in Spain survived - at times flourishing, at others dwindling into warring, fratricidal fiefdoms. But the culture and science they brought with them - including long-buried knowledge from Greece, forgotten in Europe's Dark Ages - was to have an even more enduring impact.<br>Now, in a book as gracefully written as it is compellingly narrated, Richard Fletcher reveals that culture in all its fascinating disparity, telling as much about the differing waves of Islamic conquest and immigration (and, thereby, about a thousand years of Islamic history in North Africa and the Middle East) as about the culture and history of Spain itself.<br>In the tradition of Steven Runciman's elegant histories of the Crusades and John Julius Norwich's engrossing accounts of Venice and Byzantium, Richard Fletcher's Moorish Spain entertains even as it enlightens. It is history at its best: wonderful storytelling by a true and recognized scholar writing with wit and style.</p><p><b>Richard Fletcher </b>was Professor of History at the University of York. He was the author of <i>The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity </i>(California, 1999)Fletcher, author of the well-received The Quest for El Cid ( LJ 3/1/90), intends his new work to be an introduction to the culture and history of Moorish Spain. He has written for the traveler who wants more background than the average guidebook provides or for anyone who wants a thoroughgoing overview of the subject. Fletcher uses translations from Moorish poetry and historical anecdotes to illuminate a significant period in European history, arguing that Moorish Spain acted as a channel through which the philosophical and scientific works of the Islamic world passed to European Christendom. One example given by Fletcher is the development of Thomist philosophy, which sought to reconcile revelation and reason. The Moorish philosopher Averroes, whose treatises on Aristotle had attempted such a reconciliation of philosophy and religion in an Islamic context, was cited by St. Thomas Aquinas 503 times. This is recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Robert Andrews, Duluth P.L., Minn.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Milosz&#39;s ABC&#39;s</h2><p>Presents a collection of musings on a variety of subjects, listed alphabetically, including literary characters, historical figures, and real and imagined places.</p><p>Czeslaw Milosz is the recipient of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature.

But a wicked entity called the Shadow Knight is endeavoring to control the doors between the two worlds, and only evil can get through. It falls to two imaginative eleven-year-olds&#x2014;Victoria Deveny, from 1890 Britain, and Elliot Good, from 1966 America&#x2014;to thwart his plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Faerie Queen dispatches the youths&nbsp;on separate quests to retrieve orbs of power that will ultimately defeat the Shadow Knight. Their bravery and friendship are tested as the children travel to fantastic realms and face life-threatening dangers&#x2014;from dragons to flying pirate ships to a wicked sorceress queen&#x2014;before they're reunited to confront the dreaded Shadow Knight. <p></p><p></p></p><p><b>B. E. MAXWELL</b> is captivated by British fantasy literature of the nineteenth century, as well as by&nbsp;the work of Victorian artists such as Arthur Rackham and Cicely Mary Barker. These influences inspired him to tell his daughter and his niece the story that would become <i>The Faerie Door</i>, his first novel for young readers. He lives in Rocky Hill, Connecticut.Chapter 1<p></p>Northumberland, England, 1890<p></p>~<p></p>Victoria Deveny was very cross. She stood beside her bags on the platform of the small railway station at Cotby, watching the Blue Comet Limited puff away into the distance, until the black smoke from the locomotive&#x2019;s stack dissipated against the far-off treetops.<p></p>Victoria scowled and twirled her parasol in annoyance. She tried fixing the porter with a contemptuous look, but her efforts were wasted. He continued to nap in his chair behind the ticket window, his green visor pulled down low over his eyes.<p></p>Victoria folded her arms, sighed, and prodded one of her brown leather bags with her toe. After a bit she sighed once more and sat down on the wooden bench in the shade beneath a posted railway timetable. Uncle Dexter had probably forgotten all about her! How dare he! Her eyes narrowed menacingly. If he really had forgotten, he would regret it.<p></p>Finally, she heard the rattle of an approaching carriage. Her uncle&#x2019;s driver was very apologetic, thrice regretting his tardiness and twice begging her pardon. Victoria tossed her head and stepped disdainfully past him up into the carriage, her nose high in the air.<p></p>"Fetch all my bags and hurry, if you please," she said as she settled into the velvet cushions. "I have been waiting quite long enough. And do be careful&#x2014;there are breakables."<p></p>In a moment they were off, down a long wooded lane leading from Cotby toward Summerwind, her uncle&#x2019;s estate.<p></p>As they drove, Victoria found her anger fading. The day was beautiful and her summer holidays had barely begun. No more French conjugations or Latin verbs for three whole months! And best of all, no grueling ballet practices under the exacting eye of Mademoiselle Andre, repeating the same postures at the bar and the same formal steps over and over again.<p></p>The carriage moved between sunlit fields and shaded hedgerows. After following a slow curving rise, they reached thickets of purple lilac and the scent of the blossoms filled the interior. Victoria heard the drowsy hum of bumblebees, even over the rattle of the wheels. One especially large bee buzzed in through the carriage window and flew about aimlessly for a moment before realizing its mistake and flying out again, without so much as a how-do-you-do.<p></p>Despite all her efforts to the contrary, Victoria smiled at the beauty of the day. The carriage descended into a hollow and rumbled across the stone bridge that spanned one corner of a dappled pond. A dragonfly flitted alongside and then abruptly darted away to disappear across the water.<p></p>Victoria felt a thrill as they reached a bright meadow brimming full of blue cornflowers. She could finally glimpse the rooftops and chimneys of Summerwind just ahead.<p></p>Out in the meadow, a hundred feet from the carriage, Victoria&#x2019;s uncle Dexter sprang into view, butterfly net in hand. He was gesturing enthusiastically, wearing field tweeds, pith helmet, and thick-soled expedition oxfords. Her uncle did not even seem to notice her carriage, but continued leaping eagerly toward a large butterfly, whose meandering flight was taking it farther afield by the second.<p></p>Victoria rolled her eyes. And to make matters worse&#x2014;if that were even possible&#x2014;Penrod Periwinkle and his bookish sister Adelaide burst from the undergrowth to join her uncle. They, too, were armed with huge butterfly nets. Adelaide clutched her hat to her head with one hand and waved her net at Victoria with the other. She was the only one who bothered to notice Victoria&#x2019;s arrival at all. Then, with shrill cries of "Nymphalidae" and "Camberwell Beauty," all three madly dashed off.<p></p>Victoria shook her head and shut her eyes to blot out the sight of her uncle and his ridiculous friends. "Whatever butterfly that is, I am positive that it is quite safe indeed&#x2014;especially from them!" she muttered to herself. Victoria had noticed, however, that the butterfly sported an exceptionally large wingspan. In fact, she hadn&#x2019;t ever seen one quite half as large!<p></p>By the time the carriage passed through the wrought iron archway, Victoria already had its door half open. Before the wheels had crunched to a halt on the gravel drive, she was halfway up the steps to the formal entrance doors, where Summerwind servants awaited her arrival.<p></p>First in line was Mrs. Hampstead, her uncle&#x2019;s housekeeper, head of the maids and kitchen staff. Beside Mrs. Hampstead stood Sheffington, the butler and chief of the menservants. Accompanying them was Ellen, an upstairs maid.<p></p>At least I have a welcoming committee among the staff, thought Victoria.<p></p>Mrs. Hampstead greeted Victoria formally. Although the housekeeper seemed incapable of exhibiting affection in the customary sense, she had two traits that Victoria admired above all. She was both punctual and predictable. One could set a railway timepiece by Mrs. Hampstead&#x2019;s activities. If Victoria wished to prowl the house at night, or explore its attics at odd hours, she had only to memorize Mrs. Hampstead&#x2019;s unvarying schedule to know precisely where she would be at any given moment. This knowledge had served Victoria well in times past.<p></p>Sheffington bowed stiffly, hands held rigidly at his sides, his thumbs aligned precisely to his trouser seams. Victoria was always amazed at how he could fasten his collar so tightly and keep his tie so perfectly straight. Sheffington had lines of seriousness permanently etched in his face, but his genuine fondness for Victoria was revealed by the slight smile that appeared only when she was present.<p></p>Victoria said a polite hello to Mrs. Hampstead, but as she reached out to shake Sheffington&#x2019;s hand, she quite shocked him by quickly embracing him instead. "Hello, Sheffington. I hope you are well!" she said solemnly in her deepest and most serious tone, which was neither very deep nor too serious. Sheffington coughed, then beamed. He replied that he hoped she would have a delightful summer holiday.<p></p>Ellen smiled at Victoria as she curtsied, properly clad in her starched uniform, lace apron, and prim ribboned cap. Victoria greeted her affectionately, and as the two of them disappeared into the house, a footman was summoned to help with her things.<p></p>"I am going to have many adventures this summer, Ellen, and explore all the secrets of this house!" Victoria promised. As they ascended the first flight of stairs, she paused, dancing on alternating feet, to tug off her side-buttoned boots.<p></p>"Has Mrs. Hampstead excused you from your other duties so you can be devoted to me?"<p></p>"Yes, miss, just as usual for your holidays," Ellen replied. "And I have set out some suitable clothes for you."<p></p>"Thank you, Ellen. Have you seen any of the strange lights out in the wood, like we glimpsed last autumn, before I had to return to horrid old Prosingham?"<p></p>"Yes, miss, I saw them once, and Clara saw them a second time. The last time was perhaps a fortnight ago."<p></p>"I will get to the bottom of this," Victoria declared. "And you must cover for me when I disappear on my excursions."<p></p>Ellen smiled. "I am at your service, miss."<p></p>As they climbed the last few steps, a clock struck the Windsor chimes in a distant corner of the house. They entered a short hallway that led to Victoria&#x2019;s suite of rooms. To the right was the door to Victoria&#x2019;s bedchamber, and to the left was the nursery. Some of Victoria&#x2019;s earliest memories were of playing in that nursery. Nothing ever changed at Summerwind. If she rummaged about in the toy chest, she was certain she would find some of her favorite playthings.<p></p>But she would not find the big rocking horse. For it had frightened Victoria so much that her uncle had it taken away. It had alarming glass eyes, and once when she had a fever, it had vividly haunted her dreams. In her delirium it came alive, rocking down the nursery passage, mouth agape. But instead of neighing, it groaned a horrid human-sounding groan, and its eyes blazed crimson. When the maids awakened her from her dream, she realized that it was she herself who had been groaning.<p></p>Victoria took off her gloves and her boater, tossing them onto the plush cushions of her window seat. The window seat, where she often slept, was one of her two favorite things about the room, the other being the elaborately carved bookcase completely filling one wall. Next to back issues of Chatterbox Magazine, rows and rows of leather-bound volumes lined the shelves. Victoria didn&#x2019;t remember most of the stories she had been read as a child. She was best at making up her own adventures as she went along.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p><p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Bruce Maxwell<p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

But as anthropologist Jack Weatherford, author of INDIAN GIVERS, brilliantly shows, the Europeans actually grafted their civilization onto the deep and nourishing roots of Native American customs and beliefs. Our place names, our farming and hunting techniques, our crafts, the very blood that flows in our veins--all derive from American Indians ways that we consistently fail to see.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Jack Weatherford</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</i>,&nbsp;<i>Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Secret History of the Mongol Queens</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The History of Money</i>, among other acclaimed books. A specialist in tribal peoples, he was for many years a professor of anthropology at Macalester College in Minnesota and now divides his time between the United States and Mongolia.Another insightful and provocative contribution by anthropologist Weatherford (Indian Givers, 1989, etc.) to increasing national recognition of the extent of white America's debt to Native Americans. Taking far-off Tuktoyaktuk, inside the Arctic Circle in Canada, as a point of departure, Weatherford illustrates that interdependency between white and Indian cultures persists today- -there, between a DEW-line radar installation and the old Inuit community nearby. Historically, the author details how early explorers from DeSoto to Lewis and Clark used native guides, and how many natural resources (timber, furs, cash crops of tobacco and King Cotton among them)--the economic foundation of white North America--were husbanded and harvested by Indians. Moreover, Weatherford points out, Indians as well as Africans were enslaved, and from native women as companions to European trappers and traders arose prominent mixed-blood groups such as the proud M&#x201a;tis of central Canada. Evidence past and present combines to indicate contributions to language, military tactics, food, and philosophy, creating in each case an example concise and scholarly, yet at times lively and even poetic. Quietly subversive but wonderfully accurate--a comprehensive, memorable tribute to the pervasive Native American influence on those who destroyed a way of life even as they assimilated it. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As a reviewer in <i>Library Journal</i> noted: "Wright is one of those rare and gifted poets who can turn thought into music. Following his self-prescribed regimen of purgatio, illuminato, and contemplatio, Wright spins one lovely lyric after another on such elemental subjects as sky, trees, birds, months, and seasons. But the real subject is the thinking process itself and the mysterious alchemy of language: 'The world is a language we never quite understand.'"</p></p><p>As he juggles his inquiries about language, landscape, memory, and God throughout the six groups of short poems that make up <i>Chickamauga</i>, Wright refuses to reach for the easy conclusion. In this, his poems embody Keats's notion of "negative capability": the ability to consider multiple concepts without "irritably reaching after fact." "We're placed between now and not-now," as he writes in "Reading Lao Tzu Again in the New Year." Wright's scope is admirably broad, and he endows the familiar with new shadows. In "Sprung Narratives" he considers what he's learned in the 30 years since a trip to Italy, and concludes, "Unlike a disease, whatever I've learned / Is not communicable." Instead of trying to explain with a vocabulary wherein "each word / Is a failure," Wright tells himself to: <blockquote> Sit still and lengthen your lines,<br> Shorten your poems and listen to what the darkness says<br> With its mouthful of cold air.<br> </blockquote> Born in Tennessee in 1935, Wright now teaches at the University of Virginia. He grounds his mystic's poetry in a Southerner's physical world. But like Charlie Citrine, hero of Saul Bellow's <i>Humboldt's Gift</i>, Wright betrays provincial expectations by inquiring into the most subtle and nuanced states. The grace one finds in Wright's poems is universal; his Blue Ridge easily becomes Mt. Fuji, Mt. Olympus, or Kilimanjaro. A craftsman, he understands the limits of his tools. In "Aftermath," for instance, he confides, "We who would see beyond seeing / see only language, that burning field." Through his rarefied country music, though, Wright holds out a branch of hope: "Loss is its own gain. / Its secret is emptiness."<p><b>Charles Wright </b>is the United States Poet Laureate.

It is from this point that the novel is especially interesting, and it offers a highly satisfying ending. As usual, Rosenblat's reading is smooth, and her ability to convey the characters' emotions is superb.

In the 1960s, however, many of Strachey's friends and lovers were still alive; much could not be said, and access to letters and resources was restricted. Since then, almost all his circle has died, and homosexuality in England has been decriminalized.<br>In telling Strachey's life anew, Holroyd has drawn on a wealth of previously unavailable material, bring fresh candor and accuracy to his account of Strachey's friendships with E. M. Forster, Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell, Ralph and Frances Patridge, and his companion Dora Carrington, among others. In many of Bloomsbury's three-cornered relationships, Holroyd could lay claim to only two sides of the triangle. Now he has all three with which to recount the story of this extraordinary man and his complex world. At the center of the drama is the long-lasting relationship between Strachey and Carrington and their "Triangular Trinity of Happiness" with Ralph Partridge. In equally elegant and humorous prose, Holroyd shows the parts that many men and women played in this comedy of manners as it developed into a tragedy.</p><p>Besides the biographies of Augustus John, Bernard Shaw and Lytton Strachey (which was filmed as Carrington), Michael Holroyd has written two volumes of memoirs, Basil Street Blues and Mosaic. He is the current president of the Royal Society of Literature and the only non-fiction writer to have been awarded the British Literature Prize. He lives in London and Somerset with his wife, the novelist Margaret Drabble.Holroyd's big, gossipy life of English historian Lytton Strachey (1880-1932), first published in 1968 and now in a revised, expanded edition, offers a vibrant, intimate portrait of the Bloomsbury circle, their love affairs, jealousies and creative ferment. In Eminent Victorians (1918), Strachey stripped away the pious camouflage of Victorian society, targeting hypocrisy, imperialism, militarism and religion. Holroyd, biographer of G.B. Shaw, credits Strachey with revolutionizing historical biography by emphasizing character and hidden sexuality and subverting traditional forms through caricature and psychological innuendo. Drawing on thousands of letters by Strachey and his Bloomsbury coterie, Holroyd unearths details of Strachey's adolescent self-loathing and sexual guilt; his proposing marriage to Virginia Woolf in an effort to renounce his homosexuality; his pacifism during WWI; and his relationship with his adoring live-in companion, painter Dora Carrington, who tolerated his gay affairs. This panoramic account of Strachey's trajectory from hypersensitive, shy Cambridge undergraduate to social and literary lion is peopled with the likes of D.H. Lawrence, Rupert Brooke, John Maynard Keynes, T.S. Eliot, Lady Ottoline Morrell, Augustus John and Bertrand Russell.

But an official pardon through his father-in-law Burne-Jones, a senior agent at MI6, means he is free to go although forever in Burne-Jones&#x2019;s service. His newest operation will take him back to Berlin, which is now the dividing line between the West and the Soviets. A backstory of innocence and intrigue unravels, one in which Wilderness is in and out of Berlin and Vienna like a jack-in-the-box. When the Russians started building the Berlin wall in 1961, two unfortunate Englishmen were trapped on opposite sides. Geoffrey Masefield in the Lubyanka, and Bernard Alleyn (alias KGB Captain Leonid Liubimov) in Wormwood Scrubs. In 1965 there is a new plan. To exchange the prisoners, a swap upon Berlin's bridge of spies. But, as ever, Joe has something on the side, just to make it interesting, just to make it profitable. <i>The Unfortunate Englishman</i> is a thrilling tale of Khrushchev, Kennedy, a spy exchange . . . and ten thousand bottles of fine Bordeaux.

Since reptiles are cold-blooded creatures, most humans don&#x2019;t instinctively understand their requirements the way they understand the needs of a cat or dog. Herp expert Philippe de Vosjoli and his team of veterinarians and authors seek to make keepers confident in their ability to properly care for their bearded dragons through this most informative book. A key component of caring for bearded dragons, according to the authors, is recognizing that their needs change as they develop. De Vosjoli states in the introduction to the book, Looking at the life stages of bearded dragons also made [the authors] aware that, like humans, they undergo changes in growth and behavior, which may require the dedicated owner to make adjustments in husbandry (and general care) to meet the needs of each life style.&#x201d; The Bearded Dragon Manual is the first book to present this information that is so critical to the proper maintenance of these very popular reptiles. <br> <br>Colorfully illustrated, The Bearded Dragon Manual provides chapter-length coverage on the following topics: selecting a dragon, making a home for a dragon, heating and lighting, diet and feeding management, and behavior. The feeding chapter, which includes as age-by-age guide to nutrition, was co-written with veterinarian Dr. Susan Donoghue. A chapter on breeding discusses strategies for breeding dragons, requirements, conditioning, incubation, and potential problems encountered. Lizard vet extraordinaire Dr. Roger Klingenberg has written a chapter on recognizing and treating bearded dragon diseases, in which he discusses how to recognize a sick dragon, various internal and external parasites, nutritional disorders as well as kidney disease, prolapses, egg-binding, respiratory infections, and eye problems. The chapter concludes with a four-page chart for troubleshooting health problems.

Although traditionally understood as an inevitable clash of cultures or as a classic example of conflict on the frontier between Indians and whites, in the view of James D. Drake it was neither. Instead, he argues, King Philip&#39;s War was a civil war, whose divisions cut across ethnic lines and tore apart a society composed of English colonizers and Native Americans alike. According to Drake, the interdependence that developed between English and Indian in the years leading up to the war helps explain its notorious brutality. Believing they were dealing with an internal rebellion and therefore with an act of treason, the colonists and their native allies often meted out harsh punishments. The end result was nothing less than the decimation of New England&#39;s indigenous peoples and the consequent social, political, and cultural reorganization of the region. In short, by waging war among themselves, the English and Indians of New England destroyed the world they had constructed together. In its place a new society emerged, one in which native peoples were marginalized and the culture of the New England Way receded into the past.</p><p>SOMETIMES DESCRIBED as "America's deadliest war", King Philip's War proved a critical turning point in the history of New England, leaving English colonists decisively in command of the region at the expense of native peoples.

It was an hour before dawn but Bruno Courreges was already awake, his thoughts churning with memories and regrets about the woman who had until recently shared his bed. For a brief moment he froze, stilled by the eerie sound that carried such a weight of history and alarm. This same siren had summoned his neighbors in the small town of Saint-Denis to war and invasion, to liberation and peace, and it marked the hour of noon each day. Its swooping whine also served to call the town's volunteer firemen to their duty. Such an emergency invariably required his presence as the sole municipal policeman of Saint-Denis. The brusque summons shook him from his melancholy thoughts, and he thrust aside the tangled sheets.<br><br>As Bruno dressed and swigged from a carton of milk by way of breakfast, his cell phone rang. It was Albert, one of the two professionals who led the town's team of pompiers, and he, his truck and his night patrol were already en route.<br><br>"There's a big fire up on the old road to Saint-Chamassy," Albert began, an urgency in his voice. "It's at the top of the hill, just before the turn to Saint-Cyprien. A barn and a big field. This time of year it could spread for miles if the wind gets up."<br><br>"I'll join you there," Bruno said, tucking the phone between his shoulder and his ear as he tried to fasten his shirt buttons. He squeezed his eyes shut to draw on the map of the sprawling commune of Saint-Denis that he kept in his head. It was composed of the roads he patrolled, the isolated homes and hamlets he visited, the farms he knew, with their flocks of geese and ducks and pigs and goats that made this the gastronomic heartland of France. His familiarity with the ground over which he hunted, and searched for mushrooms after it rained, meant that he knew his district like a woman knows her own face.<br><br>"There's no report of any casualties," said Albert. "But you'd better alert the hospital as soon as you've told the mayor. I'm calling Les Ezyies and Saint-Cyprien for support. Can you stop at the station and make sure they send up the spare water tankers when the rest of the guys get in? Drive one of the tankers yourself if you have to. We'll need all the water we can find. I'll see you at the scene."<br><br>"What about evacuation? There are four or five farms up there."<br><br>"I don't know yet, but the mayor had better start phoning people to put them on alert. Get a warning out on Radio Perigord."<br><br>Bruno prayed that his elderly and sometimes temperamental van would start right away. He quickly fed his dog, left his chickens to fend for themselves and ran to the vehicle. It started at once, and he drove one-handed down the lane from his cottage toward town, thumbing the auto dial on his phone to alert first the mayor and then the chief doctor, each of whom already had been awoken by the siren. Lights were on inside people's homes, and the town was stirring as Bruno drove at high speed to the gendarmerie to tell old Jules on the night desk to call the radio station in Perigueux and to dispatch men to seal off the road near the fire. As Bruno hurried back out to his van, Captain Duroc rushed into the main building from the small barracks next door, still pulling on his uniform jacket. Bruno left Jules to explain the situation. At the fire station, Ahmed and Fabien were struggling with the towing rig for the tankers as the other volunteers were arriving, sufficient to man the trucks and tenders. Bruno drove on as fast as his van could manage, his blue light flashing and the town siren still howling into the night behind him.<br><br>By the time he reached the open road by the railway line to Sarlat, he could see the broad glow in the hills above. Bruno shivered with apprehension. Fire frightened him. He had always treated it with a wary respect, which had become something close to fear since he'd hauled some wounded French soldiers from a burning armored car during the Balkan Wars. His left arm still carried the scars. In his bedside drawer was the Croix de Guerre the government had awarded him for his efforts, after a lengthy debate among bureaucrats as to whether the Bosnian peacekeeping mission was actually a war.<br><br>Bruno wondered if there was anything in the jumble in the back of his van that might serve as protective gear. There would be gloves and a cap in his hunting jacket, his hunting boots and some swimming goggles and a bottle of water in his sports bag. Maybe there was an old tennis shirt he could soak and use as a face mask. He pushed the accelerator harder as the van labored up the hill. He knew this area well but tried in vain to remember where there might be a barn this high up on the plateau, where the land was too poor for farming. It was mainly woods and thin pasture, some tumbledown shepherds' bories of old stone, plus the tall microwave tower.<br><br>As Bruno rounded the last bend before the plateau, the whole night sky ahead seemed to pulse and glow red above the trees. He remembered the dry summer, the river so low that the tourist canoes had to search out the deeper channels. Now he could smell the burning. He slowed down. At least some of the pulsing red was the flashing light of Albert's fire truck. Bruno parked off the road. He put on his boots, gloves and hunting cap, looked at his swimming goggles and stuffed them into a pocket, poured water on the tennis shirt he had found and ran up the road to the truck, where two pompiers stood bracing the spouting hose, silhouetted against the flames.<br><br>"Not a barn, just a big wooden shed. We couldn't save it," shouted Albert over the crackling of the flames and the roaring noise of the truck. He reached into the back of the vehicle and pulled out a heavy yellow fireman's jacket and handed it to Bruno, nodding his approval of the stout boots on Bruno's feet.<br><br>"It could have been a lot worse. We were here in time to stop it from spreading to the woods."<br><br>More pulsing lights began to grow on the road as Ahmed approached with the second fire truck and the big water tanker, and then there were flashes of blue as the gendarmes arrived in their big van. Albert was calling the neighboring fire chiefs to say their help would not be needed.<br><br>"No sign of any people?" Bruno asked. Albert shook his head and ran off to direct the second truck. "How did you hear about the fire?" Bruno called after him.<br><br>"Anonymous call from the phone booth in Coux," Albert shouted back.<br><br>Bruno made a mental note of that as he tried to get his bearings. He remembered this road being thickly wooded on both sides, but where he stood there was a break in the trees, and a new-looking dirt track curved into the wide stretch of field and pasture that was burning low but steadily. What little breeze he felt on his cheeks was coming toward him and toward the woods, where the pompiers were soaking the brush to deny the flames any fresh fuel. The biggest fire was the ruin of what had been the shed, standing amid the charred crop. Bruno's foot caught on something. He looked down and saw a small metal flag, like the one farmers used to identify which seeds they had sown in which rows. He plucked it from the ground and, in the light from the truck headlights, read the words AGRICOLAE SECH G71. That meant nothing to him, but he stuffed the flag into his pocket. Shouts came from behind, and he turned to see more yellow-clad pompiers struggling up with a second hose, which bucked in their hands as it filled and a much more powerful jet of water lanced onto the edge of the woods.<br><br>"Smell anything funny?" Albert asked, suddenly looming beside him. "Come on, this way."<br><br>He led Bruno across the still smoldering ground and around the side of the shed until they were upwind, where it was quieter. Inside the shed, a metal table supporting some charred machinery was still hot enough to spit as water dripped from what was left of the roof beams. Two smoking roof timbers thrust into the sky, perched on top of what looked like an old filing cabinet. Bruno caught a stink of burned plastic and rubber, and something else.<br><br>"Gasoline?" he asked.<br><br>"That's what I think. We'll send some trace evidence off to the lab in Bordeaux, but I'll bet this was deliberate. If you go over to the far side of the field, you'll smell it again. Somebody was thorough--he got the crops, the shed, everything. This is going to be a job for you a lot more than for me."<br><br>"If it's arson, it's the Police Nationale," said Bruno. It would be a good idea to seal off the phone booth in Coux to check fingerprints, Bruno thought.<br><br>"If it's arson against crops," said Albert, "it's local. Some farmers' feud or somebody's been playing games with another man's wife. And that means the Police Nationale won't have the first idea where to start."<br><br>Bruno nodded, peering at something in the shed that struck him as odd. "Albert, have you ever seen a filing cabinet and office stuff like that in a farmer's shed in the middle of a field?"<br><br>"No. Looks like it could be a computer, though there's no electricity up here. Maybe it's an old typewriter."<br><br>Bruno turned away and was walking across to the point where the charred crops stopped when an explosion came with a flat crunch. Light flared, and a rush of heat stunned him as he turned and saw Albert topple to his knees amid the debris of the shed, which was bright with new flames.<br><br>His forearm up to protect his eyes against the searing heat, Bruno ran instinctively toward Albert and grabbed him by the collar. Fighting down fear as he plunged into the flames that seemed hungry to engulf him, Bruno hauled Albert back. The fire chief's legs dragged limply through the flaring wood of the shed, and his trousers were on fire. Once the two men were clear of danger, Bruno spread-eagled himself over Albert's legs to douse the flames with the fireproof material of his jacket. And then the other firemen were there, spraying them both with foam from handheld extinguishers.<br><br>Ahmed hauled Bruno up and shone a flashlight into his face, shouting, "You okay?" while others tended to Albert. Bruno nodded, shook himself and rose a little jerkily to his feet, brushing away the thick foam that covered him.<br><br>"A bit scorched, but nothing serious thanks to that jacket Albert gave me," he said. "What the hell was that explosion?"<br><br>"An aerosol; maybe a can of paint or kerosene. Some bastards leave an almost empty fuel container at the scene and close the cap. The vapor can make it go off like a bomb once it's hot enough," Ahmed said with a shrug. "Albert never should have gotten that close. We'd have carried on hosing it but we had to put water on the edge of the fire, stop it from reaching the woods."<br><br>"My fault," said Bruno. "I was asking him about the equipment inside the shed."<br><br>Albert had been lifted to his feet and was shaking his head to clear it, flecks of the foam flying off from his helmet and jacket. Bruno asked him how he was.<br><br>"I'll live to make a fool of myself another day. Some damn thing hit me on the ear," said Albert. He put his hand up to the side of his head and it came away bright with blood. One of the firemen gave him a bottle of water; he drank deeply, then rinsed his mouth, spat and looked across at Bruno and nodded once. "Thanks," he said quietly, handing him the water. Albert's hand was trembling. So, Bruno noticed, was his own.<br><br>"How are the legs?" Bruno asked. His voice was hoarse, and his throat hurt. The thought of the gasoline and of the fire being set deliberately brought a surge of anger and a sudden sharp memory of the airfield at Sarajevo, the crunch of mortars and the screams of the men inside the armored car. Bruno had often wondered if he'd ever be able to go back into a fire. Now he knew, but he shuddered and took a deep breath to control himself.<br><br>"Not bad. I wear flameproof undertrousers, just like the race car drivers," Albert said, his voice raised. He spoke quickly as the adrenaline rushed through his system. "I'm okay, just a bit dizzy from whatever hit me."<br><br>More shouting erupted from behind them, and another fireman came running up.<br><br>"Hey Chief, there's a water main. The gendarmes just ran into a standpipe."<br><br>Albert looked at Bruno and rolled his eyes. "Probably the first time our Captain Duroc ever found anything, and even then he had to run into it."<br><br>They headed back to the road, where a jet of water was fountaining high from a broken standpipe and Fabien was doing something violent with a heavy wrench in the light of the only headlight on the gendarmes' van that wasn't broken. Captain Duroc could be heard shouting angrily at his men. Fabien gave a final twist of his wrench and the water stopped.<br><br>"We can use this now," he said. "There's not much pressure, but enough to damp down the embers."<br><br>"Where's that pipe going? Why isn't it on my maps?" Albert demanded angrily, mopping at his bloodied ear with a handkerchief.<br><br>"Looks like it goes from the water tower to the microwave station. That's Ministry of Defense, so they have a guard post," said Fabien. "And this standpipe is here because they have another pipe going off to that shed and the field. Looks to me like there's some fancy irrigation system installed."<br><br>"Irrigation? Up here?" said Albert. "Somebody's got more money than sense."<br><br>"Funny that the one field that has its own piped water supply is the one that gets torched," said Bruno. "You ever heard of this Agricolae?" He reached into his pocket and pulled out the small metal flag he had plucked from the ground.<br><br>"No. Could be some experimental seed, I suppose, but I never heard of anything like that up here."<br><br>They went back to the truck, where the elderly mayor, Gerard Mangin, stood patiently by the road. Behind him was a row of parked cars belonging to locals who had come to watch the excitement.</p><h2>I Myself Am a Woman: Selected Writings of Ding Ling</h2><p>A comprehensive collection of writings by the revolutionary writer, feminist, and literary dissident Ding Ling (1904-85), one of the most colorful and important Chinese women writers of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Ding Ling</b> (1904-1986) was the pen name of Jiang Bingzhi.

Perfume has helped them to pray, to heal, and to make love. And as long as there has been perfume, there have been perfumers, or rather the priests, shamans, and apothecaries who were their predecessors. Yet, in many ways, perfumery is a lost art, its creative and sensual possibilities eclipsed by the synthetic ingredients of which contemporary perfumes are composed, which have none of the subtlety and complexity of essences derived from natural substances, nor their lush histories. <i>Essence and Alchemy</i> resurrects the social and metaphysical legacy that is entwined with the evolution of perfumery, from the dramas of the spice trade to the quests of the alchemists to whom today's perfumers owe a philosophical as well as a practical debt. Mandy Aftel tracks scent through the boudoir and the bath and into the sanctums of worship, offering insights on the relationship of scent to sex, solitude, and the soul. Along the way, she imparts instruction in the art of perfume compositions, complete with recipes, guiding the reader in a process of transformation of materials that continues to follow the alchemical dictum solve et coagula (dissolve and combine) and is itself aesthetically and spiritually transforming.<br></p><p><p>"To this most extraordinary treatise on the history and making of perfume, Aftel... brings sheer delight in the bouquet of aromas in the natural world." --Publishers Weekly</p> <p>"[A] compulsively readable compendium of perfume legend, lore, and instruction." --San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p>For centuries people have taken instinctive pleasure in rubbing scents into their skin, using them to pray, to heal, and to make love and war.

A group of bandits went on a rampage throughout the city and its suburbs, robbing banks and wealthy Parisians, killing anyone who got in their way, and always managing to stay one step ahead of the police. But Jules Bonnot and the Bonnot Gang weren't just ordinary criminals; they were anarchists, motivated by the rampant inequality and poverty in Paris.<br>John Merriman tells this story through the eyes of two young, idealistic lovers: Victor Kibaltchiche (later the famed Russian revolutionary and writer Victor Serge) and Rirette Ma�trejean, who chronicled the Bonnot crime spree in the radical newspaper <i>L'Anarchie</i>. While wealthy Parisians frequented restaurants on the Champs-�lys�es, attended performances at the magnificent new opera house, and enjoyed the decadence of the so-called Belle �poque, Victor, Rirette, and their friends occupied a vast sprawl of dank apartments, bleak canals, and smoky factories.

Jean Cadoret is a hunchback of charm and intelligence who comes from town to settle on his inherited estate where he plans to farm scientifically. His wife Aimee, a former small-time opera singer, and adoring little daughter Manon work by his side. But the jealous Soubeyransthe local patriarch Cesar and his nephew, the clownish Ugolincraftily plug up a spring on Jean's farm and wait for him to fail. When a cruel summer drought drives Jean to despair and eventually death, the Soubeyrans buy his land cheaply and divert the water for their own lucrative carnation farm. In the sequel, Manon appears as a picturesque goat-girl/dryad, scampering over the rocks in cast-off opera gear and playing her pipes. She avenges her parents and falls in love. The end brings astonishing revelations. Pagnol depicts his villagers as post-Roman pagans whose "natural brutality" shows through their Christian veneer. As in the author's earlier naturalist novels, the landscape and the willful spring are forces molding human fates. Those who offend nature, here lushly described, pay a penalty. There are eight pages of photos (not seen by PW), from the recently released films, which follow the novels closely. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fox Two: America&#39;s First Ace in Vietnam</h2><p>I am a fighter pilot by heart, and I love turning and twisting through the skies in search of a good fight. But this is more than a story of aerial combat. It is a story of a ship, USS Constitution, and the men who sailed her, their feelings, thoughts and actions during the Vietnam conflict. Fox Two describes many of our air-to-air combats, recorded as they happened. We didn&#39;t win them all, but lessons learned and some of the restrictions that we had to live with - and in some cases die with - should be known by every American so that your sons will not pay the same price as did many of our men in a war we weren&#39;t allowed to win.... From 1965 through 1971 the US Navy scored 29 kills with Sidewinders. During the time period of this book, Navy pilots were credited with 23 Sidewinder kills and one Sparrow kill. All five of my victories were made with the Sidewinder, making Lieutenant (jg) Bill Driscoll and me the first US aces of the Vietnam War. Thus the Title, Fox Two. --- excerpts from book&#39;s Preface</p><p></p><h2>Rising Son (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)</h2><p>Searching desperately for his missing father, Captain Benjamin Sisko, Jake Sisko enters a wormhole that hurtles him across the galaxy , to an encounter with an alien ship populated by a strange alien crew whom he joins on a bizarre and unexpected adventure through the universe.

The Temple welcomes many home, the faithful and the Chosen. </i></p><p><i> A Herald, unforgotten but lost to time, a Seer of Visions to whom the Teacher Prophets sing, will return from the Temple at the end of this time to attend the birth of Hope, the Infant Avatar. The welcomed Herald shares a new understanding of the Temple with all the land's children. Conceived by lights of war, the alien Avatar opens its eyes upon a waxing tide of Awareness. </i></p><p><i> The journey to the land hides, but is difficult; prophecies are revealed and hidden. The first child, a son, enters the Temple alone. With the Herald, he returns, and soon after, the Avatar is born. A new breath is drawn and the land rejoices in change and clarity.</i> </p><p> * * * </p><p> Something was wrong. </p><p> Jake knew it before he was entirely conscious. He groped for understanding, roaming his mind for how and why...and because he was scared, he thought of his father, and the simple, strong emotions drew him up through the dark. </p><p> "Dad?" </p><p> He opened his eyes at the sound of his own soft, scratchy voice, felt the numbing cold, saw his bag floating amid a frozen snow of empty food packets, like a symptom of sleep, a detail of some strange dream. He was floating, too, facing the single, outdated transporter at the back of the shuttle, muted red emergency lighting taking the sting out of the unlovely decor. Obviously, the <i>Venture's</i> AG had gone out...but it was the deep chill that had tipped him to wake up, that immediately had him moving before he could think clearly. Cold was bad. </p><p> Jake turned clumsily and kicked off the port wall, aiming for the tiny vessel's decidedly dead-looking flight controls; there were no alarms sounding and even the console screen was blank, a blind eye. He arranged his thoughts on the way, ignoring the growing urge to panic even when he realized that he couldn't hear anything -- not even the soft hum of the recyclers. </p><p> <i>I was in the wormhole, waiting, about to give up and go back to the station...and everything started spinning, the prophecy was coming true, I thought, except I couldn't control the ship; I started to black out, and...</i> </p><p> "And now I'm here," he muttered, grabbing the back of the pilot's seat and pulling himself down. Wherever that was. He tucked his feet under the chair, hooking his ankles under the manual height adjust, and tapped at the computer's old-fashioned console keys for a diagnostic. </p><p> Nothing happened. No light, no sound. He took a deep breath and went through the sequence to call up the shuttle's fail-safe backup system -- and it failed, not even a glimmer of power. He did it again, slowly and carefully, the knot in his stomach tightening further as he understood it was a lost cause. Except for the emergency lights, which ran off an independent battery, there was nothing on the ship that was working. </p><p> <i>Okay, okay, don't freak out...check the main conduit, it's got to be a blown relay, I can fix that....</i> </p><p> A darker thought intruded. <i>What if it's not?</i> </p><p> As far as anyone on the station knew, he had taken his newly acquired shuttle to Earth, to see his grandfather. He'd been too embarrassed to admit that he was following a scrap of prophetic text into the wormhole, hoping to bring his father home...though considering his current situation, finding Dad had just dropped a notch or two on his priority list. Nobody knew where Jake was, himself included, his fix-it skills were barely competent, and it was already cold enough for him to see his breath, a pale, ethereal mist hanging in front of the blank viewscreen. Where was he? How long had he been unconscious? And with the <i>Venture</i> completely dead, how much longer before he ran out of air, or hypothermia set in -- </p><p> -- or is this all part of the prophecy? </p><p> The thought stopped him, refocused his thinking. The torn bit of parchment that had brought him here stated clearly that the journey to the land would be difficult... </p><p> <i>...but that I would enter the Temple alone and return with the "Herald"</i> before <i>Kas has the baby.</i> Kas was still months from her due date; maybe this was all part of it, maybe the Prophets had him and he just had to wait awhile.... </p><p> "Knock it off," he told himself firmly. Daydreaming about salvation was as bad as straight-up panic; he knew better. He needed to check the conduit, and the relays, and about fifty other things. Anything else was a waste of time. </p><p> Jake pushed off from the chair to get his bag -- there was a light panel in it he was going to need -- reminding himself that he'd been in tight situations more times than he could count...definitely more than most men his age. Somehow, things always worked out. This would, too, because the alternative...there just wasn't one. </p><p> Jake set his jaw, clenching his teeth so they wouldn't chatter, carefully avoiding the feelings of fear and dread that had taken root in the shadows of his mind, that were beginning to grow in the powerful absence of light. </p><p><br> <i>Stardate 53267.5. My name is Jacob Sisko; I'm human and a citizen of the United Federation of Planets. Whoever finds this, please contact any Federation outpost or any official of the planet Bajor and let them know what happened...that I ventured into the wormhole by myself and was caught in some sort of storm, one that caused severe damage to my shuttle. In spite of my best efforts over the last several hours, I've been unable to restore power to this ship, and will soon succumb to hypothermia. </i></p><p><i> These are my last words, it seems. I wish I could leave behind some profound statement about life or death, but all I can think is that this isn't what I expected. It doesn't seem real. All my life, I've heard "adults" talk about how young people don't really understand that they're going to die someday, and I always thought I was exempt from that particular patronizing bit of wisdom, probably because I lost my mother so early. That, and how I grew up. Who my father is. My life has been anything but sheltered. </i></p><p><i> The war changed things for everyone, I know, but even before that, before I learned firsthand about mortal terror on the front line at Ajilon Prime, I thought I understood that death was never all that far away -- that it could slip in and out of somebody's life without warning, taking, stealing, changing things. I knew, I understood, but I can see now, I didn't feel it. Because no matter how bad things got, he was with me. My father created the foundation of who I am. Guided me. He was...reality. There was a way that things weren't real for me until I could tell him, could take or ignore his advice, could feel his love for me and know that I wasn't alone. The way I'm alone now, finally understanding that I'm going to die -- this is real. </i></p><p><i> I thought I had let the need of a son for his father become the friendship of two men. I should have broken away earlier, perhaps, beyond just physical distance, beyond the surface. I should have sought my own way emotionally, looked inside of myself instead of to him...but so much of what I am is from him. It was too easy to ask instead of search, made all the easier because of his strength and certainty, even when he didn't know the answers. He has this way of making it okay, that the answers weren't always there, that things would unfold as they should. Maybe I should have done a lot of things different. Except...isn't it better that I had that time with him, now that he's gone? That we were still so close, now that it's over? My life... </i></p><p><i> Tell them it was hypothermia. There are worse ways. Already I'm getting sleepy and my fingers are cold, very cold; I can barely feel them; I don't know if I'm making sense anymore and I want to cry but I can't. Tell Kas I'm sorry and that I love her, that she has become to me what I would have wanted with my mother, and I'm sorry I won't be there for her and the baby. Tell Nog I said to look out for her, he's my best friend and I love him, too. I just wanted to find Dad so bad, I thought I could accept it but then I started to hope and I had to come. But he's not here and I'm alone its so cold. I was wrong and Tell them I'm sorry I died.

You're going to be all right, I've got you." </p><p> The low voice, soft, warm, strong hands lifting him, cradling. Someone on an intercom, a woman, was talking about something, but all Jake cared about was that deep, loving voice. </p><p> He felt tears threaten, tears of love and joy, an ache in his throat that hurt worse than the cold, but then he slipped back into the dark, lulled into sleep by the same feelings that had woken him not so long ago. His father held him; he was safe. </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Paramount Pictures.

Sarah, a young Jewish girl, lives in eastern Poland, where the Russians have taken control of her town and imposed harsh restrictions. The family must celebrate Hanukkah in secret; Lili, a girl from western Poland whom the family shelters, is arrested. Eventually Lili is released, but when the Germans attack they force the family into a small ghetto. Jews are being murdered in the streets, and Sarah's brother, David, knows that a family, the Bielskis, have escaped into the forest. Sarah's mother, believing that life in the forest would be worse, refuses to leave the ghetto even after the family survives a selection by the Germans. When ordered onto a train that will take them to Treblinka, her father tells Sarah to leave; she must find the Bielskis in the forest in order to survive. The fact that this is a true story lends the narrative further immediacy and suspense. Compelling reading for the young.

A famous and bestselling author in later life, he started as a navy man and graduate of Annapolis who was forced to retire because of tuberculosis. A socialist politician in the 1930s, he became one of the sources of Libertarian politics in the USA in his later years.

Heinlein</b><br><b>1</b><b>THE HEINLEINS OF BUTLER, MISSOURI</b><b>B</b>utler, Missouri, has been the county seat and market town for Bates County since the resettlement of the "dark and bloody ground" after the Civil War. Eighty miles southeast of Kansas City, in 1907 it was in its third decade of sustained growth and had achieved a kind of stability that let its residents--most of them--enjoy what is now seen as a golden age of America, though in October of that year they were in for another depression, as debilitating as the savage depression of 1893.Both the Heinlein and Lyle families were well established in Butler. Rex Ivar Heinlein and Bam Lyle Heinlein grew up there (though Rex's father, Samuel Edward Heinlein, was a traveling salesman working out of Kansas City), and they began dating when both were attending Butler's Academy (the local equivalent of a college). Rex enlisted for the Spanish-American War, and when he came back, sick and "on a shutter," as family lore has it,1 they were married in November 1899.The couple immediately moved into Bam's parents' house--a common practice in the days before installment credit contracts brought the purchase of a house within the range of newlyweds. Extended families were the rule, and houses were built to accommodate generations living under the same roof. Even so, the Lyle m�nage must have been crowded: Bam's six-year-old brother, Park, was living at home, and when her older sister, Anna, was widowed, leaving her to support her daughter, Thelma, by teaching, she, too, had gone back home to Butler and to her father's house.Fortunately, Dr. Lyle's horse-and-buggy medical practice was flourishing; even with the additional people in residence, he was able to indulge in trotting races as a hobby, running a fashionable sulky--a light cart with only a driver's seat--in the annual Bates County Fair, drawn by a half-brother of the famous Dan Patch.In 1899 Rex Ivar had prospects: he was working as a clerk and bookkeeperin his uncle Oscar Heinlein's dry goods store in Butler, a kind of combination hardware and general store. Uncle Oscar, in his mid-thirties, was unmarried and childless; it was understood that, if he applied himself and worked hard, Rex Ivar might inherit O. A. Heinlein Mercantile one day.2Rex Ivar and Bam started a family: their first child, a boy, was born on August 15, 1900. They named him Lawrence Lyle Heinlein, honoring grandparents on both sides of the family. On March 25, 1905, another boy was born. They named him Rex Ivar, after his father. A year later, Bam Heinlein became pregnant again.On July 7, 1907, not-quite-seven-year-old Larry Heinlein was delegated to keep his two-year-old brother, Rex, under control, at least till his father got home from work.3 Bam Lyle Heinlein was upstairs for her lying-in, attended by her father's office partner, Dr. Chastain, since it would have been improper for Dr. Lyle to attend his own daughter. Shortly after 3 P.M., she delivered a fine baby boy. They named him Robert Anson, after her great-grandparents Robert Lyle and Anson S. Wood.But by 1907 Rex Ivar's prospects in Butler no longer seemed quite so rosy. Like the biblical Jacob, he had served his uncle for seven years, and that was enough. The October stock market crash and Panic of 1907 threw the country into a depression. That winter Rex Ivar decided to give up on Butler and joined his father and uncles (plus aunt Jessie) in Kansas City.Rex Ivar's father, Samuel Edward Heinlein, had been in Kansas City for some years, working as a traveling salesman for the Kansas-Moline Plow Company. In 1903 he moved to the Midland Manufacturing Company, where his brothers Harvey and Lawrence also got work as salesmen and his sister Jessie was a clerk. In 1906 Samuel Edward was promoted from traveling salesman and assistant manager to full manager for Midland Manufacturing (soon to become Midland Implements, Jobbers of Implements &amp; Vehicles), and with the attendant raise he bought a larger house. In December 1907 Rex and Bam and the three boys moved into his father's house. Rex Ivar, too, started out as a traveling salesman for Midland, and Robert remembered being taken several times by his mother to the train station at the foot of Wyandotte (building torn down in 1914) to meet his father returning home from his sales route.4 Soon, however, Midlands promoted him to clerk and cashier, and he was able to rent a small house of his own at 2605 Cleveland.5 Now Rex and Bam felt truly launched in Kansas City.6 They would work hard and strive--and have many more children.Robert Anson was an easy baby for his mother. She later said he gave no trouble and always entertained himself.7 Robert later recalled that he was fedon Eagle Brand condensed and sweetened milk, rather than breastfed like the rest of the children.8 No explanation for this has survived. Sometimes it just happens that lactation does not start.Robert's infancy cannot have been easy for him, though: a middle child, between the older boys and the new babies that came one by one, he was outcompeted for his mother's attention. He said on several occasions that he was a stammerer as a young man, and stammering is often associated with family disturbances during the time when a child is learning to speak, roughly from about ages two through five--for Robert, that was from 1909 through 1912.9 Bam seems to have preferred her father's day-to-day care during her pregnancies (there are no records of perinatal doctoring or midwifery), and she spent a great deal of time in her father's house in the early days.A baby girl, Louise, arrived on February 27, 1909. In 1910 Midland failed and went out of business. In 1911 brothers Samuel and Harvey Wallace Heinlein put the Heinlein family's expertise to work and set up their own company--Heinlein Brothers, Agricultural Implements--across the street from the old Midlands site. Rex Ivar was their clerk-cashier.10He was thirty-one years old; he was also sickly and had a series of operations during Robert's childhood. Work, church, and politics left very little time to spend with the family. When Bobby was five years old, he noticed unusual tension in the house; he later found out his father had received word from a local doctor that he had only three months to live--a false alarm, it turned out.11The children shared two bedrooms, with the smallest children in a crib in the parents' bedroom. Nor were there enough beds to go around. Heinlein recalled as an adult that he slept on a pallet on the floor for years, in a constant state of amiable warfare with baby sister Louise, "a notorious pillow-swiper (with nine in the family, pillows were at a premium) clear back when she pronounced the word <i>pillow</i> as 'pidduh.'"12As is common in large families, the older children had to help raise the younger. Bobby adored his oldest brother, Lawrence, but not brother Rex. Rex was only two years older, but gave himself privileges Bobby did not appreciate. A family anecdote from about 1911 or 1912 illustrates the problem: Rex came running in to their mother complaining--tattling--that Bobby was standing by the curb and saying hello to everybody who came along, and Rex didn't approve of that.13 Rex continued trying to raise his brother for a very long time, and this was a source of strain between them as they grew older.On September 10, 1912, another boy was born, Jesse (later called "Jay")Clare, named for his Aunt Jessie. Then Rose Elizabeth on July 23, 1918, named apparently for the paternal and maternal grandmothers, Rose Adelia Wood and Elizabeth Johnson (much as Robert Anson had been named for the grandfathers). Mary Jean, arriving on Christmas Day in 1920, rounded out the family at seven children. Bam Heinlein was forty-one years old.Until 1914 Bam and the children went by train to live with Dr. Lyle in Butler during summers and holidays. There she and the children could get out from under many of the pressures and privations of their life in Kansas City and Bam could let the children run (relatively) free in the cleaner, rural environment. Rex Ivar was bound to his desk in Kansas City, joining them when he could get away--weekends occasionally; a full week when possible. (In 1909 he had taken a temporary job with a bank in Butler while Bam was pregnant with Louise.)14Young Bobby seems to have been a particular favorite of Dr. Lyle's, and the affection was certainly reciprocated; Dr. Lyle built a special seat in his sulky for the boy, so he could accompany him on his medical rounds. Dr. Lyle did not shield the realities from the boy: outside the very largest and most advanced hospitals, medical practice consisted of iodine and aspirin, and encouraging people to heal themselves.15 Years later, Robert remembered seeing Dr. Lyle burn and bury his instruments after an infectious disease case, possibly anthrax.16Dr. Lyle also taught Bobby to play chess at age four. As Dr. Lyle died in August 1914, when his grandson had just turned seven years old, these incidents must have made a very deep impression on him. Heinlein was to take Dr. Lyle as his pattern for all the American frontier virtues of intellectual range and toughness, patriotism, and pragmatic morality in his fictional portrait of Lazarus Long's grandfather, Dr. Ira Johnson, in <i>Time Enough for Love</i> (1973) and <i>To Sail Beyond the Sunset</i> (1987).But Kansas City was home, more and more. The Heinleins had an almost proprietary, family interest in Swope Park, since an uncle Ira (who had married Bobby's Aunt Jessie) worked for the city, and he drew for his own amusement a detailed map locating every rock and shrub in the park (he also achieved renown for collecting a large ball of twine).17 Later, Heinlein recalled stripping and playing naked in the park, before World War I, pretending he was Tarzan.18 Nakedness became an important sensual experience for him. Years later, for fictional purposes, he r...</p><h2>Political Theology: Four New Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty (Columbia Studies in Political Thought / Political History)</h2><p>In this strikingly original work, Paul W. Kahn rethinks the meaning of political theology. In a text innovative in both form and substance, he describes an American political theology as a secular inquiry into ultimate meanings sustaining our faith in the popular sovereign. <br><br>Kahn works out his view through an engagement with Carl Schmitt's 1922 classic, <i>Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty</i>. He forces an engagement with Schmitt's four chapters, offering a new version of each that is responsive to the American political imaginary. The result is a contemporary political theology. As in Schmitt's work, sovereignty remains central, yet Kahn shows how popular sovereignty creates an ethos of sacrifice in the modern state. Turning to law, Kahn demonstrates how the line between exception and judicial decision is not as sharp as Schmitt led us to believe. He reminds readers that American political life begins with the revolutionary willingness to sacrifice and that both sacrifice and law continue to ground the American political imagination. Kahn offers a political theology that has at its center the practice of freedom realized in political decisions, legal judgments, and finally in philosophical inquiry itself.</p><p>Paul W.

Since Operating Instructions and Bird by Bird, her fans have been waiting for her to write the book that explained how she came to the big-hearted, grateful, generous faith that she so often alluded to in her two earlier nonfiction books. The people in Anne Lamott&#39;s real life are like beloved characters in a favorite series for her readers--her friend Pammy, her son, Sam, and the many funny and wise folks who attend her church are all familiar. And Traveling Mercies is a welcome return to those lives, as well as an introduction to new companions Lamott treats with the same candor, insight, and tenderness. Lamott&#39;s faith isn&#39;t about easy answers, which is part of what endears her to believers as well as nonbelievers. Against all odds, she came to believe in God and then, even more miraculously, in herself. As she puts it, &#34;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers.&#34; At once tough, personal, affectionate, wise, and very funny, Traveling Mercies tells in exuberant detail how Anne Lamott learned to shine the light of faith on the darkest part of ordinary life, exposing surprising pockets of meaning and hope.</p><p></p><h2>THRILL-OGY HORROR AT THE HAUNTED HOUSE; TERROR AT THE ZOO; DANGER AT THE FAIR (3 STORIES IN 1 PAPERBACK)</h2><p>Two kids.

When a newly discovered poem by Emily Dickinson surfaced in a Sotheby's auction in 1997, a library in the poet's hometown quickly snatched it up. Four months later, however, the poem was returned as fake; it was the work of Mark Hofmann, a rare books dealer and a master falsifier who was then in prison for murder. Using the Dickinson incident as a guide, Worrall reconstructs the life and crimes of the 20th century's best forger (Hofmann's fake of the 17th-century "Oath of a Freeman" passed a carbon 14 dating test). A Mormon by birth, Hofmann had a contempt for his religion that led him to counterfeit its missing sacred documents: he made his own inks, used chemicals to "age" the paper, fabricated documents to authenticate others and spread misinformation to bolster his authority. The lies and subterfuges of this meticulous though imperfect confidence man resulted in the murder of two innocent people, one of them a man who could have exposed him. Some of Worrall's depictions of minor characters feel a bit hackneyed, but his rendering of Hofmann's deep-seated frustrations is engrossing, and positing the forger's quasi-political subversions against the Mormon faith and what he saw as its illusions makes for a juicy read. A history of literary forgery and forensic accounting of handwriting keeps the pages turning, though a late return to the reclusive Dickinson feels like a forced justification of the title.

But within the ranks of the 101st, a sub-unit attained legendary status at the time, its reputation persisting among veterans over the decades. <br><br>Primarily products of the Dustbowl and the Depression, the Filthy13 grew notorious, even within the ranks of the elite 101st. Never ones to salute an officer, or take a bath, this squad became singular within the Screaming Eagles for its hard drinking, and savage fighting skill--and that was only in training. Just prior to the invasion of Normandy, a "Stars and Stripes" photographer caught U.S. paratroopers with heads shaved into Mohawks, applying war paint to their faces. Unknown to the American public at the time, these men were the Filthy 13. After parachuting behind enemy lines in the dark hours before D-Day, the Germans got a taste of the reckless courage of this unit - except now the men were fighting with Tommy guns and explosives, not just bare knuckles. In its spearhead role, the 13 suffered heavy casualties, some men wounded and others blown to bits. By the end of the war 30 men had passed through the squad. <br><br>Throughout the war, however, the heart and soul of the Filthy 13 remained a survivor named Jake McNiece, a half-breed Indian from Oklahoma - the toughest man in the squad and the one who formed its character. McNiece made four combat jumps, was in the forefront of every fight in northern Europe, yet somehow never made the rank of PFC. The survivors of the Filthy 13 stayed intact as a unit until the Allies finally conquered Nazi Germany. <br><br>The book does not draw a new portrait of earnest citizen soldiers. Instead it describes a group of hardscrabble guys whom any respectable person would be loath to meet in a bar or dark alley. But they were an integral part of the U.S. war against Nazi Germany. A brawling bunch of no-goodniks whose only saving grace was that they inflicted more damage on the Germans than on MPs, the English countryside and their own officers, the Filthy 13 remain a legend within the ranks of the 101st Airborne.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface<br>Introduction Jake McNiece<br><br>Chapter 1 Creating a Legend<br>Chapter 2 Fuel for the Myth<br>Chapter 3 A Bridge in Normandy<br>Chapter 4 Surviving Holland<br>Chapter 5 Rescue of a Division<br>Chapter 6 End of the War<br>Chapter 7 Get-Together<br>Epilogue The Moral of the Story<br><br>A Soldier&#x2019;s Prayer by Jack Agnew<br><br>Notes<br>Bibliography<br>Index<br></p><p>Richard E.

Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book <em>The Price of Inequality</em> and suggests ways to counter America&#x2019;s growing problem. With his signature blend of clarity and passion, Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice&#x2015;the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.</p><p>Gathering his writings for popular outlets including <em>Vanity Fair</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>, Stiglitz exposes in full America's inequality: its dimensions, its causes, and its consequences for the nation and for the world. From Reagan-era to the Great Recession and its long aftermath, Stiglitz delves into the irresponsible policies&#x2015;deregulation, tax cuts, and tax breaks for the 1 percent&#x2015;that are leaving many Americans farther and farther beyond and turning the American dream into an ever more unachievable myth. With formidable yet accessible economic insight, he urges us to embrace real solutions: increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthy; offering more help to the children of the poor; investing in education, science, and infrastructure; helping out homeowners instead of banks; and, most importantly, doing more to restore the economy to full employment. Stiglitz also draws lessons from Scandinavia, Singapore, and Japan, and he argues against the tide of unnecessary, destructive austerity that is sweeping across Europe.</p><p>Ultimately, Stiglitz believes our choice is not between growth and fairness; with the right policies, we can choose both. His complaint is not so much about capitalism as such, but how twenty-first-century capitalism has been perverted. His is a call to confront America's economic inequality as the political and moral issue that it is. If we reinvest in people and pursue the other policies that he describes, America can live up to the shared dream of a more prosperous, more equal society.</p></p><p>Joseph E. Stiglitz is a Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist and the best- selling author of Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited: Anti- Globalization in the Age of Trump, The Price of Inequality, and Freefall.

In order to achieve these goals, this volume employs an original approach that takes into account how people learn and remember. Many vocabulary builders simply present their words in alphabetical order, many provide little or no discussion of the words and how to use them, and a few even fail to show the kinds of sentences in which the words usually appear. But memorizing a series of random and unrelated things, especially for more than a few hours, can be difficult and time-consuming. The fact is that we tend to remember words easily and naturally when they appear in some meaningful text, when they have been shown to be useful and therefore worth remembering, and when they have been properly explained to us. Knowing precisely how to use a word is just as important as knowing what it means, and this book provides that need additional information.</p><p></p><h2>Taste of Home Down Home Cooking For One Or Two</h2><p>Family favorites, without all the leftovers.

The source and historical significance of each document is explained in the editor&#39;s remarks and notes. This work has been critically acclaimed and has been accepted as the definitive work in the field. **Lightning Print On Demand Title</p><p>More than 50 years ago, back when the prevailing postulate was that the Negro had no real history, historian and author Aptheker began trudging among the pioneers, tracking, gathering, and assembling obscure or inaccessible firsthand testimony by blacks on the breadth and depth of the African American experience. In 1951, after 15 years, the first fruits of his labor appeared, covering the years from 1661 to 1910. The 160 documents in the present volume-announced as the final installment of what has become a classic-bring the series within a generation of the present. Dealing with a more contemporary time and an era of mass publications, it is narrower in scope and has less manuscript material, commentary, and explanation than earlier volumes, but it adds handsomely to the rich record and offers a helpful bibliography on issues and events. This entire series is essential for any collection with even a pretense of dealing with U.S. or African American history. Highly recommended.<br><i>Thomas J.

After clashing with her parents over her refusal to marry, she was offered a lifeline by family friends who suggested a trip to Egypt, a country which she had always longed to visit. This book follows her journey along the Nile: a romantic adventure, but also a deeply spiritual one. It was during the trip that she found emotional recovery, the inspiration to resist parental pressure, and the resolve to pursue her dream of a career in nursing. By an extraordinary coincidence, taking the same boat from Alexandria was an unpublished French writer, Gustave Flaubert. Like Nightingale, he was at the crossroads in his life that was to lead to future acclaim and literary triumph. As it did for her, Egypt for him represented escape and freedom as well as inspiration. But as a wealthy young man travelling with male friends, he had access to an altogether different Egypt: where Nightingale sought out temples and dispensaries, Flaubert visited brothels and harems. Both of them were entranced, moved and liberated by the wonders of the Nile. As privileged early travellers, they saw an ancient landscape unchanged for centuries, and visited monuments still familiar to tourists today. And both wrote magnificently about the sights they saw. This is a book about a key moment in the life of Florence Nightingale, a tantalising portrait of a young woman on the brink of international fame. But it also wonderfully counterpoints her journey with that of a future French literary genius, and it provides fascinating insight into the early days of travel to one of the greatest tourist destinations on the planet.</p><p>Anthony Sattin is the author of several highly acclaimed books, including Lifting the Veil, The Pharaoh&#39;s Shadow and The Gates of Africa.

Avoiding the twin pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that, fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best.This wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack takes readers beyond the &#34;Science Wars&#34; to a balanced understanding of the value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.</p><p>Review by Science, July 2, 2004: &#34;Reading DEFENDING SCIENCE is like having a lively after-dinner conversation with an intelligent reader of the science studies literature who has little patience for academic extravagance and an eye for the bon mot.&#34;Susan Haack (Coral Gables, FL) is Distinguished Professor in the Humanities, Cooper Senior Scholar in Arts and Sciences, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami.

Human waste, once considered a gift to the soil, has become toxic material that has broken the essential cycle of decay and regeneration. Here, award-winning author Derrick Jensen and activist Aric McBay weave historical analysis and devastatingly beautiful prose to remind us that life&#x2014;human and nonhuman&#x2014;will not go on unless we do everything we can to facilitate the most basic process on earth, the root of sustainability: one being's waste must always become another being&#x2019;s food.</p><p>Activist, philosopher, teacher, and leading voice of uncompromising dissent, DERRICK JENSEN holds degrees in creative writing and mineral engineering physics. In 2008, he was named one of the&nbsp;<i>Utne Reader</i>&#x2019;s "50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World," and in 2006 he was named Press Action&#x2019;s Person of the Year for his work on the book&nbsp;<i>Endgame</i>.

He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Peak Oil Survival: Preparation for Life after Gridcrash</i>&nbsp;and creator of "In the Wake: A Collective Manual-in-Progress for Outliving Civilization" (www.inthewake.org).Industrial civilization is incompatible with life.... Unless it's stopped... it will kill every living being, begin environmental activists Jensen (<i>A Language Older than Words</i>) and McBay (<i>Peak Oil Survival</i>), introducing the recurring theme and thesis of this radical report on the state of Earth and call to action. The book contrasts natural systems of growth and decay, in which soil and life forms feed each other, with industrial civilization: essentially a complicated way of turning land into waste: garbage patches cover more than 40% of oceans and multitudes of fish and birds are being killed by plastic waste, now more abundant in the seas than phytoplankton. Jensen and McBay trash sustainability stars like William McDonough, who designs green buildings without questioning their unsustainable uses (truck factories and airports); the authors argue that we value our culture more than the planet that sustains it. The book is flawed by lapses into rants and rages, but Jensen and McBay's message that we need to grow up and put away the childish notion that we have the right to take whatever we want from nonhumans is eminently reasonable. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this sophisticated little picture book, V�ronique Vienne, bestselling author of (<i>The Art of Doing Nothing</i> and <i>The Art of Imperfection</i>) and a feature writer for magazines such as <i>Martha Stewart Living</i> and <i>Redbook</i>, contends that growing up doesn't simply mean you're not getting younger anymore; it means you're finally at the point in life where the real fun begins. After all, Julia Child didn't write her first bestselling cookbook until she was 49, Harry Truman wasn't elected to national office until he was 50, and Paul Cezanne didn't have a major exhibit of his paintings until he was 65. The "second part of your life is second to none," she writes, and the best is yet to come.<p> In 10 essays complemented by 25 duotone photographs, Vienne advises us to begin anew by throwing away old things ("outgrowing is part of growing up"), letting go of what's become obsolete, and reinventing adulthood ("become the kind of grown-up who makes young people wish they were pushing 40, 50 or even 60"). In short, get comfortable in your skin, with your intelligence, with your soul.

Japanese diplomats and military attaches in Europe sent these reports daily to Tokyo, believing falsely that their ciphers could not be broken. In turn, Tokyo sent its diplomats plans for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.<br><br>In Marching Orders, Bruce Lee takes these decrypts and shows, with an overlay on wartime chronological events, what their impact was on Chief of Staff George C. Marshall (plus a handful of others) and how they influenced his strategic prosecution of the war. New light is shed on myriad issues, including the ceding of Berlin to the Soviets, the wars in Africa and on the Eastern Front, the invasion of Europe, and the atomic bombing of Japan.<br><br>Challenging conventional wisdom, this book concisely documents the dreadful casualties both American and Japanese forces would have suffered in an invasion and occupation of Japan. Marching Orders demonstrates, through its interpretation of the supposedly secret communications between Japanese leaders, that Tokyo was adamant in its refusal to surrender. The difficult choices facing the Americans about how to end the war quickly are explained on a day-by-day-basis.</p><p>During Bruce Lee&#39;s long publishing career, he has been editor-researcher for Cornelius Ryan and the editor of Gordon Prange, Admiral Edwin T. Layton, Ronald Lewin, and Charles B. MacDonald. He is the coauthor of Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement. He lives in New York City.Lee, the editor of David Garrow's Pulitzer Prize-winning Bearing the Cross (LJ 11/15/86) and coauthor with Henry Clausen of Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement (LJ 9/15/92), has analyzed recently declassified Magic codes (Japanese secret crypts) and U.S. Army Intelligence documents. The result is the most complete history available of American code-breaking activity and its consequences during World War II. Lee shows convincingly how these daily decrypts influenced Generals Marshall and Eisenhower in their strategic prosecution of the war. Daily top-secret messages sent to Tokyo by Japanese diplomats in Berlin gave American leaders unique access to the thoughts and battle plans of Hitler and the German General Staff. Many of the mysteries that have eluded historians since the end of the war are much clarified: the Pearl Harbor fiasco, D-Day, why the Americans let the Russians capture Berlin, and why the decision to drop the atomic bomb was made. This is the most significant publication about World War II since the recent series of books on the Ultra revelations and should be purchased by all libraries.<br><i>Richard Nowicki, Emerson Vocational H.S., Buffalo, </i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Spirit, Many Peoples: A Manifesto for Earth Spirituality</h2><p>Argues for the appropriateness of Earth-centered religion, and supports the adoption of Native American spiritual practices by persons of any ancestry</p><p></p><h2>Gerald&#39;s Game</h2><p>Jessie is trapped: during an ill-fated S&amp;M game, she kicks her husband and induces a fatal coronary.

Applebaum draws on newly opened European archives and personal accounts translated for the first time to portray in devestating detail millions of individuals trying to adjust to a way of life that challenged their every belief, rendered worthless their every qualification, and took everything away they had accumulated.

The show trials. The boot stamping on a human face. These trappings of postwar totalitarianism have stayed in our collective memory--brutal and terrifying, yes, but after more than 50 years, also so detached from their context that they&#x2019;ve almost become political bogeymen. Anne Applebaum's <i>Iron Curtain</i> is a powerful attempt to show that totalitarianism was more than just its most public excesses. A complement to such big-picture histories as Tony Judt&#x2019;s <i>Postwar</i>, this book is concerned with the details of totalitarian rule: the diaspora of party enforcers from the USSR to the rest of the Soviet Bloc; the sudden takeover of radio stations, universities, and youth groups by partisans; the conflicted response of Catholic leaders to Stalin&#x2019;s methods. Thanks to Applebaum&#x2019;s extensive interviews and archival research, <i>Iron Curtain</i> ensures that the everyday experiences of those in the Soviet Bloc will endure, even if they soon pass beyond living memory. --<i>Darryl Campbell</i>ANNE APPLEBAUM is a columnist for the <i>Washington Post </i>and <i>Slate.</i> Her previous book, <i>Gulag</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and was a finalist for three other major prizes.

But doctors&#x2019; emotional responses to the life-and-death dramas of everyday practice&nbsp;have a profound impact on medical care. And while much has been written about the minds and methods of the medical professionals who save our lives, precious little has been said about their emotions. In <i>What Doctors Feel</i>, Dr. Danielle Ofri has taken on the task of dissecting the hidden emotional responses of doctors, and how these directly influence&nbsp;patients. <br> &nbsp;<br> How do the stresses of medical life&#x2014;from paperwork to grueling hours to lawsuits to facing death&#x2014;affect the medical care that doctors can offer their patients? Digging deep into the lives of doctors, Ofri examines the daunting range of emotions&#x2014;shame, anger, empathy, frustration, hope, pride, occasionally despair, and sometimes even love&#x2014;that permeate the contemporary doctor-patient connection. Drawing on scientific studies, including some surprising research, Dr. Danielle Ofri offers up an unflinching look at the impact of emotions on health care.<br> &nbsp;<br> With her renowned eye for dramatic detail, Dr. Ofri takes us into the swirling heart of patient care, telling stories of caregivers caught up and occasionally torn down by the whirlwind life of doctoring. She admits to the humiliation of an error that nearly killed one of her patients and her forever fear of making another. She mourns when a beloved patient is denied a heart transplant. She tells the riveting stories of an intern traumatized when she is forced to let a newborn&nbsp;die in her arms, and of a doctor whose daily glass of wine to handle the frustrations of the ER escalates into a destructive addiction. But doctors don&#x2019;t only feel fear, grief, and frustration. Ofri also reveals that doctors tell bad jokes about &#x201c;toxic sock syndrome,&#x201d; cope through&nbsp;gallows humor, find hope in impossible situations, and surrender to ecstatic happiness when they triumph over illness. &nbsp;The stories here reveal the undeniable truth that emotions have a distinct effect on how doctors care for their patients. For both clinicians and patients, understanding what doctors feel can make all the difference in giving and getting the best medical care.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Danielle Ofri, MD, PhD </b>is an associate professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and has cared for patients at New York&#x2019;s Bellevue Hospital for more than two decades.

Some of this has been probing and incisive, and some has been entertaining nonsense.<br><br> Much has been written about what doctors do and how they frame their thoughts. But the emotional side of medicine&#x2014;the parts that are less rational, less amenable to systematic intervention&#x2014;has not been examined as thoroughly, yet it may be at least as important.<br><br> The public remains both fascinated and anxious about the medical world&#x2014;a world with which everyone must eventually interact. Within this fascination is a frustration that the health-care system does not function as ideally as people would like. Despite societal pressures, legislative reforms, and legal wrangling, doctors don&#x2019;t always live up to these ideals. I hope to delve beneath the cerebral side of medicine to see what actually makes MDs tick.<br><br> One might reasonably say, <i>I don&#x2019;t give a damn how my doctor feels as long as she gets me better. </i>In straightforward medical cases, this line of<i> </i>thinking is probably valid. Doctors who are angry, nervous, jealous,<i> </i>burned out, terrified, or ashamed can usually still treat bronchitis or<i> </i>ankle sprains competently.<br><br> The problems arise when clinical situations are convoluted, unyielding, or overlaid with unexpected complications, medical errors, or psychological components. This is where factors other than clinical competency come into play.<br><br> At this juncture in our society&#x2019;s history, nearly every patient&#x2014;at least those in the developed world&#x2014;can have access to the same fund of medical knowledge that doctors work from. Anyone can search WebMD for basic information or PubMed for the latest research. Medical textbooks and journals are available online. The relevant issue&#x2014; the one that has the practical impact on the patient&#x2014;is how doctors <i>use </i>that knowledge.<br><br> There has been a steady stream of research into how doctors think. In his insightful and practically titled book <i>How Doctors</i> <i>Think, </i>Jerome Groopman explored the various styles and strategies that doctors use to guide diagnosis and treatment, pointing out the flaws and strengths along the way. He studied the cognitive processes that doctors use and observed that emotions can strongly influence these thought patterns, sometimes in ways that gravely damage our patients. &#x201c;Most [medical] errors are mistakes in thinking,&#x201d; Groopman writes. &#x201c;And part of what causes these cognitive errors is our inner feelings, feelings we do not readily admit to and often don&#x2019;t even recognize.&#x201d;1<br><br> Research bears this out. Positive emotions tend to be associated with a more global view of a situation (&#x201c;the forest&#x201d;) and more flexibility in problem solving. Negative emotions tend to diminish the importance of the bigger picture in favor of the smaller details (&#x201c;the trees&#x201d;). In cognitive psychology studies, subjects with negative emotions are more prone to anchoring bias&#x2014;that is, latching on to a single detail at the expense of others. Anchoring bias is a potent source of diagnostic error, causing doctors to stick with an initial impression and avoid considering conflicting data. Subjects with positive emotions are also prone to bias; they are more likely to succumb to attribution bias. In medicine, this is the tendency to attribute a disease to who the patient is (a drug user, say) rather than what the situation is (exposure to bacteria, for example).<br><br> This is not to say that positive emotions are better or worse than negative emotions&#x2014;both are part of the normal human spectrum. But if you consider the range of cognitive territory that doctors traverse with their patients&#x2014;genetic testing, ordinary screenings, invasive procedures, ICU monitoring, and end-of-life decisions&#x2014;you can appreciate how the final outcomes can be strongly influenced by a doctor&#x2019;s emotional state.<br><br> Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio describes emotions as the &#x201c;continuous musical line of our minds, the unstoppable humming.&#x201d;3 This basso continuo thrums along while doctors make a steady stream of conscious medical decisions. How this underlying bass line affects our actions as doctors&#x2014;and the net effect on our patients (and on doctors when we ourselves become patients!)&#x2014;is what intrigues me.<br><br> By now, even the most hard-core, old-school doctors recognize that emotions are present in medicine at every level, but typically this is lumped in with the catch-all of stress or fatigue, with the unspoken assumption that with enough self-discipline, physicians can corral and master these irritants.<br><br> The emotional layers in medicine, however, are far more nuanced and pervasive than we may like to believe. In fact, they can often be the dominant players in medical decision-making, handily overshadowing evidenced-based medicine, clinical algorithms, quality control measures, even medical experience. And this can occur without anyone&#x2019;s conscious awareness.<br><br> It could easily be argued that doctors are no more emotionally complex than accountants, plumbers, or the cable-repair guy, but the net result of doctors&#x2019; behavior&#x2014;logical, emotional, irrational, or otherwise&#x2014; can have life-and-death consequences for patients, which is to say, for all of us.<br><br> We all want excellent medical care for ourselves and our families, and we&#x2019;d like to assume that the best care comes from the doctors with the best training, or the most experience, or the best <i>U.S. News</i> <i>&amp; World Report </i>rating. However, the myriad effects of emotional underpinnings can confound all of these factors.<br><br> Despite this, the conventional stereotype that doctors are fairly emotionless continues to maintain its hold. Many trace this back to the eminent Canadian physician Sir William Osler, often considered the father of modern medicine for such revolutionary ideas as whisking medical students out of the staid classroom and bringing them to the bedside to learn medicine by examining actual patients. The current educational system of clinical clerkships and residency training is largely attributed to Osler, as are hundreds of snappy quotations. His continuing influence is apparent in the scores of diseases, endless libraries, and numerous medical buildings, hospital wings, societies,&nbsp;and awards that bear his name.<br><br> On May 1, 1889, Dr. Osler stood before the graduating medical class at the University of Pennsylvania and delivered a valedictory&#x2014; and now canonical&#x2014;speech entitled &#x201c;Aequanimitas.&#x201d;4 He stressed to these fledgling doctors that &#x201c;a certain measure of insensibility is not only an advantage, but a positive necessity in the exercise of a calm judgment.&#x201d;<br><br> While Osler may not have created these attitudes, he neatly encapsulated the general feeling about how doctors should behave.<br><br> Though he did warn against &#x201c;hardening the human heart,&#x201d; the stereotype of the detached, coolheaded physician springs from this idea of equanimity.<br><br> Popular culture has embodied this. Television doctors from Ben Casey to Gregory House are detached from their patients, lauded for their technological and diagnostic acumen. Even the selflessly idealist doctors (in <i>Arrowsmith</i>, <i>Middlemarch</i>, and <i>Cutting for Stone</i>) and the bitingly sarcastic doctors (in <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>House of God</i>, and <i>Scrubs</i>) maintain an equanimitous distance from their patients.<br><br> Every hospital dutifully includes the word <i>compassion </i>somewhere in its mission statement. Every medical school rhapsodizes about the ideals of caring. But the often unspoken (and sometimes spoken) message in the real-life trenches of medical training is that doctors shouldn&#x2019;t get too emotionally involved with their patients. Emotions cloud judgment, students are told. Any component of a curriculum upon which interns slap the &#x201c;touchy-feely&#x201d; label is doomed in terms of attendance. Hyperefficient, technically savvy medical care is still prized over all else.<br><br> But no matter how it&#x2019;s portrayed, and no matter how many high-tech tools enter the picture, the doctor-patient interaction is still primarily a human one. And when humans connect, emotions by necessity weave an underlying network. The most distant, aloof doctor is subject to the same flood of emotions as the most touchy-feely one. Emotions are in the air just as oxygen is. But how we doctors choose&#x2014;or choose not&#x2014;to notice and process these emotions varies greatly. And it is the patient at the other end of the relationship who is affected most by this variability.<br><br> This book is intended to shed light on the vast emotional vocabulary of medicine and how it affects the practice of medicine at all levels. Hopefully, the next time we find ourselves in a patient gown, we&#x2019;ll better understand the workings of those who care for us. &#x201c;Cognition and emotion are inseparable,&#x201d; Groopman observes. &#x201c;The two mix in every encounter with every patient.&#x201d; In some scenarios, this mix is highly beneficial to patients. In others, it can be calamitous.<br><br> Understanding the positive and negative influence of emotions in the doctor-patient interaction is a crucial element in maximizing the quality of medical care. Every patient deserves the best possible care that doctors can offer. Learning to recognize and navigate the emotional subtexts is a critical tool on both sides of the exam table.</p><h2>The Christian in Complete Armour: Daily Readings in Spiritual Warfare</h2><p><p><i>The Christian in Complete Armour: Daily Readings in Spiritual Warfare</i>&nbsp;is packed with truths for spiritual triumph.

If Issac Babel had been born in Derry, he might have written this sudden, brilliant book."<br>--Seamus Heaney<br><br>Already hugely acclaimed in Great Britain, where it was awarded the Guardian Fiction Prize and short-listed for the Booker, Seamus Deane's first novel is a mesmerizing story of childhood set against the violence of Northern Ireland in the 1940s and 1950s.<br><br>The boy narrator grows up haunted by a truth he both wants and does not want to discover. The matter: a deadly betrayal, unspoken and unspeakable, born of political enmity. As the boy listens through the silence that surrounds him, the truth spreads like a stain until it engulfs him and his family. And as he listens, and watches, the world of legend--the stone fort of Grianan, home of the warrior Fianna; the Field of the Disappeared, over which no gulls fly--reveals its transfixing reality. Meanwhile the real world of adulthood unfolds its secrets like a collection of folktales: the dead sister walking again; the lost uncle, Eddie, present on every page; the family house "as cunning and articulate as a labyrinth, closely designed, with someone sobbing at the heart of it."<br><br>Seamus Deane has created a luminous tale about how childhood fear turns into fantasy and fantasy turns into fact. Breathtakingly sad but vibrant and unforgettable, <b>Reading in the Dark</b> is one of the finest books about growing up--in Ireland or anywhere--that has ever been written.</p><p>The Derry of poet Seamus Deane's first novel, <i>Reading in the Dark</i> is a perilous place. Ghosts haunt the stairwells of apartment buildings, a curse follows two families down through the generations, close friends turn out to be police informers, and the police are as likely to persecute an innocent man as protect him. And hovering over all the violence, poverty, and despair of 1940s Northern Ireland is the specter of the "Troubles." The hero of the novel is an unnamed young man whose life turns upside down when a policeman frames him. Deception becomes his only means of self-defense. But the initial lie on the part of the policeman and the narrator's corresponding trickery are only part of the tangled web Deane weaves here. Early in the novel we learn that Uncle Eddie, an Irish Republican Army gunman, was blown up in the town distillery in 1922. In addition to sorting out his own problems, the narrator seeks the truth about his uncle's death. <p> <i>Reading in the Dark</i> sounds grim, and in some respects it is, yet leavening is provided by infusions of the Irish folktales and legends that inform the characters' daily life. And then there is the language. Deane is a poet, and his prose shows it: sex is like fire, "glinting with greed and danger"; ice snores and candles are swathed in a "thick drapery of wax." Readers looking for a thoughtful, serious, and beautifully written novel will find one in <i>Reading in the Dark.</i></p>"The intimacy of a memoir. . . the suspense of a detective story. . . .

Kennedy's closest advisor recounts in full for the first time his experience counseling Kennedy through the most dramatic moments in American history.</p><p>Sorensen returns to January 1953, when he and the freshman senator from Massachusetts began their extraordinary professional and personal relationship. Rising from legislative assistant to speechwriter and advisor, the young lawyer from Nebraska worked closely with JFK on his most important speeches, as well as his book <em>Profiles in Courage</em>. Sorensen encouraged the junior senator's political ambitions&#x2014;from a failed bid for the vice presidential nomination in 1956 to the successful presidential campaign in 1960, after which he was named Special Counsel to the President.</p><p>Sorensen describes in thrilling detail his experience advising JFK during some of the most crucial days of his presidency, from the decision to go to the moon to the Cuban Missile Crisis, when JFK requested that the thirty-four-year-old Sorensen draft the key letter to Khrushchev at the most critical point of the world's first nuclear confrontation. After Kennedy was assassinated, Sorensen stayed with President Johnson for a few months before leaving to write a biography of JFK. In 1968 he returned to Washington to help run Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign. Through it all, Sorensen never lost sight of the ideals that brought him to Washington and to the White House, working tirelessly to promote and defend free, peaceful societies.</p><p>Illuminating, revelatory, and utterly compelling, <em>Counselor</em> is the brilliant, long-awaited memoir from the remarkable man who shaped the presidency and the legacy of one of the greatest leaders America has ever known.</p></p><p><p>Ted Sorensen was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and after law school moved to Washington, D.C., where he would ultimately work for John F. Kennedy. He left the White House soon after JFK's death, and in 1966 joined a New York City law firm, where, as a prominent international lawyer, he advised governments, multinational organizations, and major corporations around the world. He is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History</em>. Sorensen remained active in political and international issues until his death in 2010.</p>In this thoughtful and fascinating autobiography, White House advisor Ted Sorensen outlines the events that made his name synonymous with President Kennedy&#39;s. This is not, however, an adoring memoir that sanitizes the author&#39;s life with the administration. Rather, Sorensen conveys his mixed emotions regarding certain events, and relays their impact on his own life and perspectives. By delivering the material himself, Sorensen adds a personal touch. Narrating with measured tones, Sorensen allows the listener a candid glimpse of embarrassing personal events, as well as his indignation at President Kennedy&#39;s indiscretions. At its core, Sorensen&#39;s book provides a revealing glimpse into many of the defining events of the Kennedy administration. Sorensen&#39;s performance adds gravitas without invoking any sense of bitterness or disingenuousness.

As it dries, the wood shrinks and hardensQand it becomes vastly more difficult to work. In the old days, wood-workers relied on the ease with which green wood could be worked to make the parts they needed, and on the way wood shrinks to hold these parts together. These old ways have almost been lost, but are revived here for the modern woodworker. Make a Chair From a Tree is a lively and informative introduction to the old ways of splitting and shaping wood straight from the tree to make a light and beautiful, yet rugged, chair. Author John Alexander presents a complete guide to making this elegantly simple chair. He tells you how to fell a tree, split suitable pieces from it and shape those pieces into the parts of the chair, how to finish it, and how to weave a bark seat.

His saga carries readers through a fantastical land filled with beauty and brooding danger as he flees the tyrannical king, Galbatorix. A mysterious elven woman haunts Eragon&#x2019;s dreams, while an ancient legacy and an unexpected inheritance shape his destiny.</p><p>Here's a great big fantasy that you can pull over your head like a comfy old sweater and disappear into for a whole weekend. Christopher Paolini began <i>Eragon</i> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p> Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. </p><p> In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <i>Eldest</i>.

There is the silence that comes with morning in a forest, and this is different from the silence of a sleeping city. There is silence after a rainstorm, and before a rainstorm, and these are not the same. There is the silence of emptiness, the silence of fear, the silence of doubt. There is a certain silence that can emanate from a lifeless object as from a chair lately used, or from a piano with old dust upon its keys, or from anything that has answered to the need of a man, for pleasure or for work. This kind of silence can speak. Its voice may be melancholy, but it is not always so; for the chair may have been left by a laughing child or the last notes of the piano may have been raucous and gay. Whatever the mood or the circumstance, the essence of its quality may linger in the silence that follows. It is a soundless echo. </blockquote> Born in England in 1902, Markham was taken by her father to East Africa in 1906.

Are these events connected? Then a skeletal hand is found in the Ditch, hailed by townsfolk as the final remains of local martyr Simon d&#39;Ambrey, and hence a holy relic.

Ellis does not disappoint, wrapping up the epic series as dramatically as one would expect. Planetary is an archaeological organization dedicated to uncovering the hidden history of the 20th century&#x2013;a history of heroes, monsters, and magic largely unknown to the general public&#x2013;in order to benefit humanity. A group of superpowered scientists, known as "the four," are also in the process of gathering similar information, but for less-noble purposes. Elijah Snow, Jakita Wagner, and The Drummer&#x2013;representing Planetary as field operatives&#x2013;need to find the four and stop them before they become too powerful. The plot concludes with a face-off between Snow and Randall Dowling, the four's mastermind. Engaging as the story itself may be, Planetary's brilliance lies more in the rich history of comics and comic lore that Ellis draws from and cleverly weaves into the narrative from beginning to end. This book stands shoulder to shoulder with such great works as Neil Gaiman's "Sandman" and Alan Moore's "Swamp Thing" (Vertigo).<i>Jason M. Poole, Webster Public Library, NY</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

In 1960 he joined the Natural History Museum in London, where he gained his doctorate while studying birds from around the world. The author of several books and over 250 scientific papers, he is an internationally acknowledged authority on the evolution and classification of birds. Alan Greensmith is a birdwatcher and traveler who has personally seen over 7,000 species. In addition to writing about the birds of his home country, Surrey, England, he has also given lectures on birds and has led field trips to Madagascar, Ivory Coast, Guatemala, and Mexico.It is hard to imagine a raison d'etre for this book, for its pretentions to be a field guide, as bruited on the dust cover, are absurd and are surprising coming from the authors, two highly respected ornithologists. What we have instead are species accounts of 800 birds, nine percent of the world total. These very brief accounts include a few sentences of general commentary; very small sections on range and nesting; a range map, color photo, and drawing showing scale; and one or two other small illustrations. This good selection of the world's birds, shown in quality photographs, is fine as far as it goes, but it is too limited to serve as an indentification guide. The traveler needs regional guides, and there are already many good ones for almost all parts of the world. Fun for browsing but otherwise only marginally useful.

In this first translation of his most important essays, Calasso brings his intellect and elegant prose style to bear on the essential thinkers of our time, providing a sweeping analysis of the current state of Western culture.<br>"Forty-nine steps" refers to the Talmudic doctrine that there are forty-nine steps to meaning in every passage of the Torah. Employing this interpretive approach, Calasso offers a "secret history" of European literature and philosophy in the wake of Nietzsche, Marx, and Freud. Calasso analyzes how figures ranging from Gustav Flaubert, Gottfried Benn, Karl Kraus, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Franz Kafka, Bertolt Brecht, and Theodor Adorno has contributed to, or been emblematic of, the current state of Western thought. This book's theme, writ large, is the power of fable - specifically, its persistence in art and literature despite its exclusion from orthodox philosophy.</p><p>Roberto Calasso is also the author of "The Forty-Nine Steps" and "Literature and the Gods." He lives in Milan and is the publisher of Adelphi.<br><br>Shepley's translation of Pasolini's Roman Nights and other stories won the first Italo Calvino Translation AwardIn this collection of essays, first published in Italy in 1991, Italian postmodernist Calasso (Ka, Literature and the Gods) explores the nexus among post-Hegelian continental philosophies, early psychiatric theory, and literary criticism. He writes compellingly of the constitutional weaknesses and political insights he identifies in the works of Nietzsche, Walter Benjamin, Goethe, Karl Kraus, Simone Weil, and more than a dozen other conceptualists. Calasso writes personably but without drama, portraying each thinker as a person who included intellectual activity among a range of other behaviors. As a result, these essays serve as critical biographies of intellects in themselves rather than as analyses of personalities or arguments for or against specific intellectual concepts. Many of these essays first appeared in journals in the 1970s, but they do not feel dated.

That said, even a dullard could pull a trigger and hurt somebody. A case in point was the reluctant prisoner trudging along ten paces ahead of Andy, dragging his feet and wailing about the insensitivity of law enforcement.<br><br>"It ain't fair," the handcuffed man whined.

His trail had led Andy across several counties along the Colorado River, but a string of angry victims had made the path easy to follow. Confronted, Deuce had fired one shot in panic, killing Andy's horse, then had thrown up his hands and begged for mercy. Andy had made him strip the saddle, bridle, and blanket from the dead animal and transfer them to his own.<br><br>"Where'd you get this horse?" Andy asked him.<br><br>"Won him in a poker game."<br><br>Andy doubted that. Deuce was not smart enough to win a poker game. He had stolen this horse like he had stolen just about everything else he had. Deuce's sweat-streaked shirt was much too large, loosely draped over thin shoulders, the grime-edged cuffs almost covering his dirty hands. He had probably lifted it from somebody's clothesline.<br><br>Andy asked, "Did you ever think about gettin' a job and makin' an honest livin'?"<br><br>"Work? I tried once. Ain't much I can do good enough that anybody'll pay me for it."<br><br>"You're not very good at this, either."<br><br>Andy wondered if he was being fair, comparing Deuce's intelligence with that of a jackrabbit. He might not be giving the rabbit enough credit.<br><br>Deuce grumbled, "Even an Indian would treat a man better than this."<br><br>"You don't know Indians." Andy did. Through several of his boyhood years he had lived among the Comanches. "Be glad you don't know them. They'd make it a mighty short acquaintance."<br><br>The afternoon was almost done when they rounded a bend in the wagon road and saw the crossroads town ahead. Its largest buildings were a courthouse, a new jail, and a church.<br><br>Deuce brightened, seeing that his long walk was almost over. He said, "I heard their old jailhouse got burned down. It wasn't no nice place. I was in it once."<br><br>"Too bad you didn't go in the church instead."<br><br>"Can't you take these handcuffs off before we hit town? It's embarrassin' to let people see me this way."<br><br>"A little embarrassment might be good for you. There was a time when they would've necked you to a tree limb. As it is, they'll likely just send you to the penitentiary."<br><br>"I already been there. It ought to be against the law to put a man in a hellhole like that."<br><br>Sheriff Tom Blessing stood in the doorway of the redbrick jail. Recognizing Andy, he grinned broadly and raised his big right hand in greeting. He looked more like a farmer than a lawman, for indeed he was a farmer first. Despite his years he still had the muscled body of a blacksmith. "Bringin' me a guest, Andy?"<br><br>Andy grinned back at him. "I hated for your new jailhouse to stand empty. The taxpayers have put a big investment in it."<br><br>Andy dreaded the handshake because Tom could bend a horseshoe double, and he could break the bones in a man's hand. He had been sheriff here so long that many people in town could not remember anyone else serving in that office. He showed no sign that he was ready to yield any ground to his age. He said, "Come on in here, Deuce. I've got a nice cell with your name on it, all swept out and waitin' for you."<br><br>Deuce sounded like a lost soul crying in the wilderness. "I'm hungry and I'm thirsty, and this Ranger has wore my feet down plumb to the bone."<br><br>Tom offered no comfort. "Write a letter to the governor." He led Deuce past barred iron doors and pointed him to a cell. When Deuce was inside, Tom slammed the door hard. That reverberating impact always reminded Andy of a gallows trapdoor dropping. There was something coldly final about it.<br><br>Tom told Deuce, "I'll bring you a bucket of water directly. There's a slop jar under the cot. Make yourself at home." He winked at Andy.<br><br>Deuce was wanted in several counties, but Andy had brought him here because this was the nearest jail, and the sun was almost down. He did not care to risk camping with the prisoner on the trail. Here he could get a good night's sleep without worrying that Deuce might try to escape. Tom would keep the horse thief in custody until the several counties that wanted him sorted out their priorities.<br><br>Tom asked, "Did he give you any trouble?"<br><br>"Not after he shot my horse. He went to blubberin'. Thought I was fixin' to kill him. I let him keep on thinkin' so till I got the cuffs on him."<br><br>"Some Rangers would've shot him for killin' their horse. Whose is that you're ridin'?"<br><br>"No tellin'. Somebody's probably lookin' for him."<br><br>"I'll check my notices." Tom fingered through a stack of papers on his desk. "I got a message for you somewhere. Yeah, here it is." He handed a paper to Andy. "Your captain sent a wire to all the sheriffs around here, not knowin' just where you'd turn up. Wants you to report in to him."<br><br>Andy felt uneasy, wondering what the captain might want. Maybe the state's finances had turned tight again and the Ranger force was being trimmed. It had happened often before. His several years of service were no guarantee that he would escape the next cut.<br><br>He asked, "Reckon the telegraph office is still open?"<br><br>"I expect so. The operator's not anxious to go home of an evenin'. His wife's been burnin' the beans lately on account of him bein' a sorry poker player."<br><br>Andy mentally composed a brief message on his way down the street. In the telegraph office he wrote it out on paper, reporting the capture of Scoggins. He read it over and penciled out every word it could spare. The state disliked paying for long messages, so Ranger reports tended to be spare on detail. He remembered one Farley Brackett had sent: Five fugitives met, three arrested, two buried.<br><br>He told the telegraph operator, "If I get a reply, I'll be stayin' the night at the jail."<br><br>"I'll fetch it over soon as it comes."<br><br>Andy stayed to watch him tap out the message. He still marveled at the progress he had seen in just the few years he had been a member of the Rangers. It seemed unreal that he could write a few lines here and know they would be received miles away in an instant. The telegraph had done much to tighten up law enforcement across Texas. Word of a fugitive could race past him and alert officers to intercept him down the road.<br><br>Andy could not imagine how it might ever get much better than that.<br><br>Back at the jail he found Tom standing in front of the woodstove. The sheriff said, "I'm heatin' some leftover beans and corn bread for the prisoner, but I expect you'll want somethin' better. I'll go with you down to the eatin' joint soon as I get Deuce taken care of."<br><br>Tom had a farm a few miles out of town, but he often spent the night in the jail rather than make the ride twice, once out and then back in the morning.<br><br>Andy said, "If it wasn't already so late I'd ride out and pay a visit to Rusty Shannon. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow."<br><br>Tom smiled at the mention of the red-haired former Ranger. "I used to worry a right smart about Rusty. He pined away for a long time after Josie Monahan died. He's fared some better since he made up his mind to marry her sister Alice. She's been like a tonic to him."<br><br>"He deserves a run of good luck for a change. He had enough bad to do for a lifetime." Rusty had been like a brother to the orphaned Andy, teaching, counseling, providing a benchmark when Andy seemed about to lose his way. "If it wasn't for Rusty I don't know where I'd be now. In jail, like as not. Or dead."<br><br>Tom had a benevolent smile his prisoners seldom saw. "You never were that bad of a kid. All you needed was guidance."<br><br>Andy had been taken by Comanche raiders when he was a small boy. They raised him until he fell back into Texan hands at about the time his voice started to change. His reintroduction to the white man's world had exposed him to many pitfalls. Even now, in his midtwenties, he sometimes found himself facing situations where the choice was difficult to make. He had always leaned heavily on Rusty's advice. When Rusty was not around, he tried to visualize what Rusty would do.<br><br>He said, "Too bad Deuce Scoggins didn't have somebody like Rusty to point the way for him when he was young."<br><br>Tom shrugged. "Might not've made any difference. There's some people that nobody can help. They've got no skill and no trade. They're too shiftless for honest work, and every time they come to a fork in the road they turn the wrong direction. I've seen a lot like Deuce, driftin' to God knows where. I've got to watch myself so I don't get to thinkin' the whole world is that way." Tom's eyes narrowed. "You've been a Ranger for a good while now. You ever find yourself gettin' cynical?"<br><br>Andy had to think a minute before he remembered what cynical meant. "I still find there's more good folks than bad ones. If I try, I can even feel a little sorry for Deuce."<br><br>"Don't tell him so. It might encourage him to get worse."<br><br>The telegraph operator found Andy sitting with Tom at a table in the restaurant, hungrily emptying a bowl of thick beef stew. He waved a sheet of paper. "Got a reply to your message. Thought you'd want to see it right away."<br><br>Andy read it slowly, his finger tracing the lines. Rusty had been more successful in teaching him about farming and being a Ranger than about reading and writing.<br><br>"Any answer?" the operator asked.<br><br>"Just say, 'Will comply.'"<br><br>That ought to be short enough to satisfy the money counters, he thought.<br><br>The operator picked up a biscuit from the table and took a big bite of it as he went out the door. Tom asked, "New orders?"<br><br>Andy nodded. "Captain says our company is bein' cut again. Says headquarters in Austin wants to reassign me to the Mexican border."<br><br>Tom frowned. "If you've ever thought about resignin', this might be the time. A man can get killed down there."<br><br>"A man can get killed anywhere. Deuce might've shot me if he hadn't hit my horse instead."<br><br>"But it's like a holy war along the Rio Grande. Been that way since the battle of the Alamo and doesn't show any sign it's fixin' to change. You're automatically somebody's enemy on sight. It just depends on how light or dark your face is."<br><br>"Sounds like the Indian wars."<br><br>"The Indian wars are over with. This one's not. Do you speak any Mexican?"<br><br>Andy swallowed a mouthful of stew. "Just a few cusswords I've picked up."<br><br>"You'll have every chance to use them, and probably pick up a bunch more."<br><br>The captain had not given Andy a deadline for showing up in Austin. Because the horse he had taken from Deuce was undoubtedly stolen, he left it in Tom's custody and bought one at the livery barn. Rangers were obliged to furnish their own horses, but the state was supposed to pay for one killed in the line of duty. Andy trusted that he would be reimbursed. If not, he would still eat, though it might be a while before he could afford a new hat or a pair of boots.<br><br>Tom approved of the black horse. He rubbed his big hand down the back and the shoulder and finally patted the animal's neck. "Got long, strong legs. He'll serve you well in a chase."<br><br>"I hope I'm the one that does the chasin'."<br><br>"If not, you'll sure be glad for those good legs."<br><br>When Andy prepared to leave town the next morning, Tom said, "Sorry I couldn't provide you a featherbed."<br><br>The jail cot had been hard as a cement floor.<br><br>Andy smiled. "At least the price was right."<br><br>Tom said, "I'll ride with you as far as Shanty's farm. Then I'll be cuttin' off and goin' home."<br><br>"I'm glad for the company."<br><br>"If they send you by San Antonio, be sure to go and visit the Alamo. It'll help you understand the trouble you'll run into when you get to the Rio Grande."<br><br>Riding down the street, Andy saw two women pull a buggy up near a general store.<br><br>Tom said, "That's Bethel Brackett and her mother."<br><br>"I know." Andy hesitated, wondering if he should ride over and greet them. He realized they had seen him, so he had no choice. "Give me a minute, Tom."<br><br>Tom smiled. "Take all the time you want. If it was me and I was thirty years younger, I'd take the whole mornin'."<br><br>Dismounting, Andy extended his hands to help the older woman down. She said, "We had no idea you were in town, Andy."<br><br>"Passin' through on duty. You're lookin' fine, Mrs. Brackett."<br><br>He turned toward the younger woman, who had been driving the horses. Bethel seemed reluctant at first to accept his help. "Andy Pickard, I ought not to speak to you."<br><br>"What did I do?"<br><br>"It's what you don't do. You don't ever come to see a girl. You could be dead and I wouldn't know about it for six months."<br><br>He thought her pretty, even if at this moment she was being petulant. He said, "If I ever die, I'll write you a letter and let you know."<br><br>"You could've let me know you were here."<br><br>"Didn't get in till late yesterday. Can't stay. I've got orders to report to Austin."<br><br>She frowned. "Even my brother Farley breaks down and sends us a few lines every six months or so. I'd write to you if I knew where you'd be."<br><br>"Half the time I don't know that myself." Andy could not tell whether she was angry or just a bit hurt.<br><br>She turned at the door. "If you run into my brother somewhere, tell him Mother and I are all right." She went inside, leaving him embarrassed and not knowing what to do about it.<br><br>Tom had watched quietly. He drew in beside Andy and said, "That little girl thinks a lot of you."<br><br>"Hard to tell it, the way she acts."<br><br>"A woman likes to have some attention paid to her, and you ain't done it. She'd follow you in a minute if you was to just ask her."<br><br>"Follow me to what? A tent camp in the brush with a Ranger company? She was raised better than that."<br><br>"You won't be a Ranger forever. Sooner or later you'll get a bellyful of cold camps and short rations. You'll start lookin' for a place to light."<br><br>"I don't know as I could ever be a farmer like Rusty. Followin' a mule down a corn row is too slow a life for me."<br><br>"Lots of Rangers go in for sheriffin' when they get tired of the service. They can uphold the law and still sleep in a decent bed most nights. If you was to decide to give it a try I'd hire you as a deputy."<br><br>"Much obliged, Tom, but so far I'm satisfied with what I'm doin'."<br><br>A former slave, Shanty York had inherited a small farm when his owner died. At first he had trouble keeping it because some neighbors objected to a black man's being a landowner. Several of them burned his cabin one night. Rusty and Tom and other friends rebuilt it and none too gently elevated Shanty's antagonists to a higher level of tolerance.<br><br>The old man looked frail. Nevertheless, he was working in his garden when Andy and Tom rode up. He seemed always to be busy so long as there was daylight to work by.

Alonzo Hereford Cushing offers valuable insights into the nature of the Civil War and the men who fought it. Brown's vivid descriptions of the heat and exhaustion of forced marches, of the fury of battle, have seldom been matched in Civil War literature.</p></p><p>"Alonzo Cushing, the subject of <i>Cushing of Gettysburg</i>, was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor."&#x2015;<p>"Cushing is the most famous lieutenant killed during the entire Civil War, and few who stop at Gettysburg fail to hear of the boy who died behind the wheel of his last gun as Pickett's Virginians surged by."&#x2015;<i>Blue &amp; Gray Magazine</i></p><p>"Vivid descriptions, accurate maps, an inside view of battle strategy from the officers' tents and finally the horror of the battles are provided in generous but readable portions."&#x2015;<i>Bourbon (Paris, KY) Times</i></p><p>"Extraordinarily gripping. This book will remain current as long as interest in the Civil War remains alive."&#x2015;<i>Charles P.

Alonzo Cushing's life and military career ended at Gettysburg in the defense of Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge. The self-sacrifice of the youthful Cushing's final acts secured his enduring fame as a tragic hero of the Civil War, but his short life, so abruptly ended, provides only modest raw material for his biographer, who founded The Civil War magazine and is chair of the Gettysburg National Military Park Advisory Commission. Not surprisingly, Brown's well-documented effort is as much a study of Cushing's family history and the Army of the Potomac's early campaigns as it is of Cushing himself. However, this fine piece of Civil War scholarship is the first full-length narrative of Cushing's life. Essential for all libraries with an interest in the Battle of Gettysburg.<br><i>- Lawrence E.

Text is perfect. Same day shipping.</p><p>Larry McMurtry, in books like The Last Picture Show, has depicted the modern degeneration of the myth of the American West. The subject of <b>Lonesome Dove</b>, cowboys herding cattle on a great trail-drive, seems like the very stuff of that cliched myth, but McMurtry bravely tackles the task of creating meaningful literature out of it. At first the novel seems the kind of anti-mythic, anti-heroic story one might expect: the main protagonists are a drunken and inarticulate pair of former Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers. Yet when the trail begins, the story picks up an energy and a drive that makes heroes of these men. Their mission may be historically insignificant, or pointless--McMurtry is smart enough to address both possibilities--but there is an undoubted valor in their lives. The result is a historically aware, intelligent, romantic novel of the mythic west that won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

No publishing year given on Scholastic copy.</p><p>On an island off the coasts of Virginia and Maryland lives a centuries-old band of wild ponies. Among them is the most mysterious of all, Phantom, a rarely seen mare that eludes all efforts to capture her--that is, until a young boy and girl lay eyes on her and determine that they can't live without her. The frenzied roundup that follows on the next "Pony Penning Day" does indeed bring Phantom into their lives, in a way they never would have suspected. Phantom would forever be a creature of the wild. But her gentle, loyal colt Misty is another story altogether. <p> Marguerite Henry's Newbery Honor Book has captivated generations of boys and girls both with its thrilling descriptions of true incidents from the tiny island of Chincoteague, and its realistic yet wonderfully magical atmosphere. This story of an animal brought into captivity poignantly reveals the powerful opposing forces of humans and nature. Wesley Dennis's pen-and-ink ponies are masterfully depicted with rippling muscles, shaggy coats, and free spirits. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Nobody could capture the Phantom. She was the wildest mare on Assateague Island.

The recording length captures the essence of Naylor's seven stories, but for those who know the book, this abridgment doesn't fully capture the power of the whole or the full devastation and pride of Naylor's characters.

Or not. In fact, Brianna is&nbsp; searching for her own son, who was kidnapped by a man determined to learn her family&#x2019;s secrets. Her husband, Roger, has ventured into the past in search of the missing boy . . . never suspecting that the object of his quest has not left the present. Now, with Roger out of the way, the kidnapper can focus on his true target: Brianna herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Written in My Own Heart&#x2019;s Blood</i> is the brilliant next chapter in a masterpiece of the imagination unlike any other.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Written in My Own Heart&#x2019;s Blood</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[<i>Written in My Own Heart&#x2019;s Blood</i>] features all the passion and swashbuckling that fans of this historical fantasy series have come to expect.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>People</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Another breakneck, rip-roaring, oh-so-addictive page-turner from Gabaldon . . .

A small clearing, out of the way, up among a scatter of great lichened boulders, under the shadow of firs and at the foot of a big red cedar; a place where no casual passerby would go, but not inaccessible. He meant to bring them up here&#x2014;the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fergus, to begin with. Maybe just Fergus, by himself. Mam had raised Fergus from the time he was ten, and he&#x2019;d had no mother before that. Fergus had known Mam longer than Ian had, and loved her as much. <i>Maybe more,</i> he thought, his grief aggravated by guilt. Fergus had stayed with her at Lally�broch, helped to take care of her and the place; he hadn&#x2019;t. He swallowed hard and, walking into the small clear space, set his stone in the middle, then stood back to look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even as he did so, he found himself shaking his head. No, it had to be two cairns. His mam and Uncle Jamie were brother and sister, and the family could mourn them here together&#x2014;but there were others he might bring, maybe, to remember and pay their respects. And those were the folk who would have known Jamie Fraser and loved him well but wouldn&#x2019;t ken Jenny Murray from a hole in the&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The image of his mother <i>in</i> a hole in the ground stabbed him like a fork, retreated with the recollection that she wasn&#x2019;t after all in a grave, and stabbed again all the harder for that. He really couldn&#x2019;t bear the vision of them drowning, maybe clinging to each other, struggling to keep&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;A Dhia!&#x201d;</i> he said violently, and dropped the stone, turning back at once to find more. He&#x2019;d seen people drown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tears ran down his face with the sweat of the summer day; he didn&#x2019;t mind it, only stopping now and then to wipe his nose on his sleeve. He&#x2019;d tied a rolled kerchief round his head to keep the hair and the stinging sweat out of his eyes; it was sopping before he&#x2019;d added more than twenty stones to each of the cairns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He and his brothers had built a fine cairn for their father before he died, at the head of the carved stone that bore his name&#x2014;all his names, in spite of the expense&#x2014;in the burying ground at Lallybroch. And then later, at the funeral, members of the family, followed by the tenants and then the servants, had come one by one to add a stone each to the weight of remembrance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fergus, then. Or&nbsp;. . . no, what was he thinking? Auntie Claire must be the first he brought here. She wasn&#x2019;t Scots herself, but she kent fine what a cairn was and would maybe be comforted a bit to see Uncle Jamie&#x2019;s. Aye, right. Auntie Claire, then Fergus. Uncle Jamie was Fergus&#x2019;s foster father; he had a right. And then maybe Marsali and the children. But maybe Germain was old enough to come with Fergus? He was ten, near enough to being a man to understand, to be treated like a man. And Uncle Jamie was his grandsire; it was proper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stepped back again and wiped his face, breathing heavily. Bugs whined and buzzed past his ears and hovered over him, wanting his blood, but he&#x2019;d stripped to a loincloth and rubbed himself with bear grease and mint in the Mohawk way; they didn&#x2019;t touch him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Look over them, O spirit of red cedar,&#x201d; he said softly in Mohawk, gazing up into the fragrant branches of the tree. &#x201c;Guard their souls and keep their presence here, fresh as thy branches.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He crossed himself and bent to dig about in the soft leaf mold. A few more rocks, he thought. In case they might be scattered by some passing animal. Scattered like his thoughts, which roamed restless to and fro among the faces of his family, the folk of the Ridge&#x2014;God, might he ever go back there? Brianna. Oh, Jesus, Brianna&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He bit his lip and tasted salt, licked it away and moved on, foraging. She was safe with Roger Mac and the weans. But, Jesus, he could have used her advice&#x2014;even more, Roger Mac&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who was left for him to ask, if he needed help in taking care of them all?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thought of Rachel came to him, and the tightness in his chest eased a little. Aye, if he had Rachel&nbsp;. . . She was younger than him, nay more than nineteen, and, being a Quaker, had very strange notions of how things should be, but if he had her, he&#x2019;d have solid rock under his feet. He hoped he <i>would</i> have her, but there were still things he must say to her, and the thought of that conversation made the tightness in his chest come back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The picture of his cousin Brianna came back, too, and lingered in his mind: tall, long-nosed and strong-boned as her father&nbsp;. . . and with it rose the image of his <i>other</i> cousin, Bree&#x2019;s half brother. Holy God, William. And what ought he to do about William? He doubted the man kent the truth, kent that he was Jamie Fraser&#x2019;s son&#x2014;was it Ian&#x2019;s responsibility to tell him so? To bring him here and explain what he&#x2019;d lost?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He must have groaned at the thought, for his dog, Rollo, lifted his massive head and looked at him in concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I dinna ken that, either,&#x201d; Ian told him. &#x201c;Let it bide, aye?&#x201d; Rollo laid his head back on his paws, shivered his shaggy hide against the flies, and relaxed in boneless peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian worked awhile longer and let the thoughts drain away with his sweat and his tears. He finally stopped when the sinking sun touched the tops of his cairns, feeling tired but more at peace. The cairns rose knee-high, side by side, small but solid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stood still for a bit, not thinking anymore, just listening to the fussing of wee birds in the grass and the breathing of the wind among the trees. Then he sighed deeply, squatted, and touched one of the cairns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Tha gaol agam oirbh, a Mh�thair,&#x201d;</i> he said softly. <i>My love is upon you, Mother.</i> Closed his eyes and laid a scuffed hand on the other heap of stones. The dirt ground into his skin made his fingers feel strange, as though he could maybe reach straight through the earth and touch what he needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stayed still, breathing, then opened his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Help me wi&#x2019; this, Uncle Jamie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I dinna think I can manage, alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dirty Bastard</b></p><p></p><p>W</p><p>illiam Ransom, Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, Viscount Ashness, Baron Derwent, shoved his way through the crowds on Market Street, oblivious to the complaints of those rebounding from his impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know where he was going, or what he might do when he got there. All he knew was that he&#x2019;d burst if he stood still.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His head throbbed like an inflamed boil. Everything throbbed. His hand&#x2014;he&#x2019;d probably broken something, but he didn&#x2019;t care. His heart, pounding and sore inside his chest. His foot, for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2014;what, had he kicked something? He lashed out viciously at a loose cobblestone and sent it rocketing through a crowd of geese, who set up a huge cackle and lunged at him, hissing and beating at his shins with their wings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Feathers and goose shit flew wide, and the crowd scattered in all directions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bastard!&#x201d; shrieked the goose-girl, and struck at him with her crook, catching him a shrewd thump on the ear. &#x201c;Devil take you, <i>dreckiger Bastard</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This sentiment was echoed by a number of other angry voices, and he veered into an alley, pursued by shouts and honks of agitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He rubbed his throbbing ear, lurching into buildings as he passed, oblivious to everything but the one word throbbing ever louder in his head. <i>Bastard.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bastard!&#x201d; he said out loud, and shouted, &#x201c;Bastard, bastard, <i>bastard</i>!&#x201d; at the top of his lungs, hammering at the brick wall next to him with a clenched fist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s a bastard?&#x201d; said a curious voice behind him. He swung round to see a young woman looking at him with some interest. Her eyes moved slowly down his frame, taking note of the heaving chest, the bloodstains on the facings of his uniform coat, and the green smears of goose shit on his breeches. Her gaze reached his silver-buckled shoes and returned to his face with more interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; he said, hoarse and bitter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; She left the shelter of the doorway in which she&#x2019;d been lingering and came across the alley to stand right in front of him. She was tall and slim and had a very fine pair of high young breasts&#x2014;which were clearly visible under the thin muslin of her shift, because, while she had a silk petticoat, she wore no stays. No cap, either&#x2014;her hair fell loose over her shoulders. A whore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m partial to bastards myself,&#x201d; she said, and touched him lightly on the arm. &#x201c;What kind of bastard are you? A wicked one? An evil one?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A sorry one,&#x201d; he said, and scowled when she laughed. She saw the scowl but didn&#x2019;t pull back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she said, and took his hand. &#x201c;You look as though you could do with a drink.&#x201d; He saw her glance at his knuckles, burst and bleeding, and she caught her lower lip behind small white teeth. She didn&#x2019;t seem afraid, though, and he found himself drawn, unprotesting, into the shadowed doorway after her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>What did it matter?</i> he thought, with a sudden savage weariness. <i>What did anything matter?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3</b></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>In Which the Women, &nbsp;As Usual, Pick Up the Pieces</b></p><p></p><p><b><i>Number 17 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia</i></b></p><p></p><p><b><i>The residence of Lord and Lady John Grey</i></b></p><p></p><p>W</p><p>illiam had left the house like a thunderclap, and the place looked as though it had been struck by lightning.

Of all the unlikely sources of succor I could have imagined&nbsp;. . .

No need for apologies or spoken forgiveness. She&#x2019;d never had to wear the mask that Jamie did. What she thought and felt was there in her eyes, those slanted blue cat eyes she shared with her brother. She knew the truth now of what I was, and she knew I loved&#x2014;and always had loved&#x2014;her brother with all my heart and soul&#x2014;despite the minor complications of my being presently married to someone else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She heaved a sigh, eyes closing for an instant, then opened them and smiled at me, mouth trembling only a little.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, fine and dandy,&#x201d; said Mrs.&nbsp;Figg shortly. She narrowed her eyes and rotated smoothly on her axis, taking in the panorama of destruction. The railing at the top of the stair had been ripped off, and cracked banisters, dented walls, and bloody smudges marked the path of William&#x2019;s descent. Shattered crystals from the chandelier littered the floor, glinting festively in the light that poured through the open front door, the door itself cracked through and hanging drunkenly from one hinge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Merde</i> on toast,&#x201d; Mrs.&nbsp;Figg murmured.

Turtle soup&#x2014;with a lot of sherry&#x2014;had certain strong and private associations for me, these being connected with Jamie, feverish delirium, and the way in which a heaving ship assists sexual intercourse. Contemplation of which would <i>not</i> assist the impending discussion in the slightest. I rubbed a finger between my brows, in hopes of dispelling the buzzing cloud of confusion gathering there. The air in the house still felt electric.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Miss Bridie Chose a Shovel</h2><p>The journey begins for a young immigrant named Miss Bridie. It is a journey of hope and uncertainty, a journey that will take her to a new land, a new home, and&#x2014;if she has chosen wisely&#x2014;a good life.<br> With elegant woodcuts, Caldecott medalist Mary Azarian brings to life Leslie Connor&#x2019;s spare story of a life rich with blessings, yet not without challenges. Here is a lyrical tribute to the millions of immigrants who left their homes to begin anew in America&#x2014;and an enchanting look at how one woman carves out a life with the help of a common shovel.</p><p>Caldecott Medalist Mary Azarian is a consummate gardener and a skilled and original woodblock artist. Many of her prints are heavily influenced by her love of gardening, and her turn-of-the-century farmhouse is surrounded by gardens that reveal an artist&#39;s vision. Mary Azarian received the 1999 Caldecott Medal for SNOWFLAKE BENTLEY, written by Jacqueline Briggs Martin. She lives, skis, and gardens in Vermont.Gr. 1-4. When Miss Bridie left her thatched cottage in Ireland in 1856, she could have taken a chiming clock or a porcelain figurine. Instead, she takes a shovel, which serves her in good stead throughout her life. She uses it to steady herself on the ship to a new place, to dig a garden, and to clear a snowy path to a moonlit frozen river, where she meets the young man she will marry. The staid text has no frills, mimicking Miss Bridie's plain life. As she uses her shovel to plant apple trees on her farm, bank the land during a flood, and, when she is old, bury her husband, children will see that Miss Birdie takes life as it is offered, with an equanimity that faces down adversity and holds close moments of joy. Not every child will be taken with a story that follows the life of a young woman as she grows old. Yet the care and crafting evident here must be admired. Caldecott award-winner Azarian's sturdy woodcuts are an excellent choice to illustrate daily life in mid-nineteenth-century America, and her pictures catch some of the emotions that the text shies away from: the small smile of contentment that comes from working on the farm; the sorrow when a fire burns down everything Miss Bridie has worked for. This is a simple pleasure that will be truly appreciated by those old enough to understand the message. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her images appear in books, on cards and posters, and the web at renyswildflowers.com. She is past president of the local chapter of the California Native Plant Society.Reny Parker is passionate about wildflowers. For 17 years, she has found and photographed them in their wild habitats around her home territory. Those images form the heart of her new pictorial and descriptive guide to 358 species of native flowers from Marin, Sonoma, Napa, and Mendocino counties. Within its pages are representatives of 83 plant families, mostly annual wildflowers but also woody perennials, vines, shrubs, trees, grasses, ferns, and several problematic exotic weeds. Parker has made it easy for even a beginner to find a particular flower in the guide. Plants are grouped by flower color and by number of petals. Species that appear similar are placed near each other, so they can be compared easily. Nontechnical descriptions of the species, composed by some of the region's best native plant specialists, accompany the photographs, often with additional information about a plant's rarity, natural and human history, and garden-worthiness, and always including bloom time and native counties. Other tidbits of information are fun and interesting: Who knew that sneezeweed (Helenium bolanderi) got its common name from its former use as powdered snuff? Or that bitter root (Lewisia rediviva), named for explorer Meriwether Lewis (who described the plant as "naucious to my pallate"), was a food staple for Native Americans? Following the main body of the book are lists and maps of wildflower hot spots in the four counties. Wildflower guide photos are often more about education than artistry, with poor lighting, competing backgrounds, and repetitive bull's-eye placement of their subjects. In comparison, Parker's beautifully composed images stand out as lovely little works of art. Each reflects Parker's devotion to her subject and her goal of inspiring others to care for these delicate gifts of nature and preserve them and their habitats for future generations. --Bay Nature Library-2007 edition<br><br>When you do venture out into nearby wildlands, a helpful guide to take along is a wonderful collection of photographs put together by Reny Parker, past president of the local chapter of the California Native Plant Society. Her book is "Wildflowers of Northern California's Wine Country and North Coast Ranges." With input from other native plant experts, Parker has compiled brief descriptions of 360 species native to Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Mendocino c ounties. Besides annual flowers, she includes a sampling of ferns, grasses, vines, shrubs and trees. The beautiful photographs are detailed close-ups of blossoms but often are paired with a wider shot of foliage, if not an entire plant. Common, botanical, and family names are given. Lists at the end identify nearby places to find wildflowers. Color-coded photos are sensibly arranged from pale to deep hues -- white, yellow, orange, pink-to-red, violet-to blue, and brown-to-green -- a helpful order for identification since a first observation of wildflowers is their color. Gardeners will be gratified that Parker, who has a colorful drought-tolerant garden in the Cloverdale hills, has noted which wildflowers are appropriate for garden culture. In sharing her passion for wildflowers in the book and on her Web site, Parker hopes to encourage us to take a closer look at nature's wonders and be inspired to preserve them for future generations. --Rosemary McCreary, Press Democrat, 4/21/07</p><h2>Back to Basics: Traditional Kitchen Wisdom: Techniques and Recipes for Living A Simpler, More Sustainable Life</h2><p>There's something to be said for simpler times, when our way of life was wholesome and healthy.

"Who said that?" <p></p>"Get thee to a nunnery." <p></p>This time he placed the source. "You&#x2019;re talking!" he said to the donkey. <p></p>"Who said that?" the animal said. "You&#x2019;re talking." <p></p>"You&#x2019;re repeating whatever you have heard most recently," Cyrus said, catching on. "That voice unit was supposed to be for braying. How can you speak words?" <p></p>"Defective workmanship," the donkey said. "You installed the wrong unit." <p></p>Cyrus sighed. So using lead instead of iron wasn&#x2019;t his only error when he constructed the donkey. When the mechanical animal was too heavy to function effectively, Cyrus&#x2019;s father Roland had given him blunt advice: remove the lead. So he had done so, and had a robot animal he could ride. <p></p>"Who said the other?" he asked. "About the nunnery. That&#x2019;s like a monastery, isn&#x2019;t it?" <p></p>"Your barbarian mother said it," the donkey answered. "You weren&#x2019;t paying attention. She was not referring to nuns." <p></p>"Not?" <p></p>"Not. According to my defective data bank, it&#x2019;s old Mundanian slang for a house of ill repute." <p></p>"What is that? I never heard of an ill house." <p></p>"Naturally you wouldn&#x2019;t know. You were created halfway innocent, for some obscure reason. But she thought it would make a man of you." <p></p>"I&#x2019;m not a man," Cyrus protested. "I&#x2019;m a cyborg. Half robot, half human. I will never be fully human." <p></p>"That&#x2019;s what comes of getting yourself delivered to a humanoid robot and a barbarian. If you wanted to be normal you should have selected a normal couple for parents." <p></p>"I didn&#x2019;t have a choice, you nutty and bolty contraption. They signaled the stork, not me." <p></p>"Neither did I have a choice, half-breed." <p></p>"Had you had one, you should have chosen a more competent builder," Cyrus said with a halfway metallic smile. <p></p>"Indubitably. But since I&#x2019;m stuck with you, how about giving me a name?" <p></p>"You&#x2019;re an ass. An equine breed. So suppose I call you&#x2014;" <p></p>"Forget it, cogbrain!" <p></p>Cyrus reconsidered. "Donkey won&#x2019;t do?" <p></p>"Let&#x2019;s abbreviate it. Don will do." <p></p>"Don Donkey. Not phenomenally original." <p></p>"Neither are you, cyborg." <p></p>"It will do," Cyrus agreed with resignation. <p></p>He rode on, careful not to remark on the animal&#x2019;s jerky gait, lest he get another sour reminder of his clumsiness in assembling it. The varied terrain of the Land of Xanth passed, becoming less familiar as they got farther away from home. They were following one of the enchanted paths, so there was no danger. <p></p>Cyrus got thirsty, so fished a can of tsoda pop from a saddlebag. He was about to open it when it slipped out of his hand, fell to the ground, and rolled off the enchanted path. "Bleep," he said. Because he had been assembled adult, he was able to use that term. It signaled spot disaffection with the situation. <p></p>There was a golden streak. Something zipped after the can, caught it in its mouth, and brought it back, holding it up. It was a dog made from pure gold. <p></p>"Thank you," Cyrus said, accepting the can. The dog zipped away again. "I wonder what kind of creature that was?" <p></p>"A golden retriever, dummy," Don said. "Check your memory bank." <p></p>The donkey was right: the information was there. Cyrus simply hadn&#x2019;t made the connection. "Thank you," he said again. <p></p>"I&#x2019;m low on fuel," Don complained. <p></p>Cyrus considered. Chances of getting where they were going today were small, so there was no point in pushing it. "We&#x2019;ll stop at the next grazing area we see," he said. <p></p>"We&#x2019;d better." <p></p>They came to a small glade strewn with sticks and tufts of old dry grass. "And this is it," Cyrus said, dismounting. <p></p>They stepped off the path. Don put his head down and picked up a stick with his mouth. He chewed, and the stick broke in two. He swallowed the pieces. <p></p>"Oh what a cute little horse!" a voice exclaimed. It was a rather young pretty girl, in fact almost nymphlike, but clothed. She had flouncing bark brown hair and sky blue eyes. <p></p>Don lifted his head to view her. "I&#x2019;m not a horse," he said sourly. "I&#x2019;m an ass." <p></p>She looked bemused. "A what?" <p></p>"A donkey," Cyrus said quickly, realizing that the Adult Conspiracy prevented her from knowing the other term. "A robot donkey. Call him Don." <p></p>"Hello, Don," she said shyly. "I&#x2019;m Piper Nymph." <p></p>"I don&#x2019;t see a pipe," Don said. <p></p>"I don&#x2019;t have a pipe. It&#x2019;s my name. My parents are Hiatus Human and Desiree Dryad. They named me." <p></p>Cyrus&#x2019;s data bank oriented. He knew of them; Hiatus was the son of the late Zombie Master, with the talent of growing things like ears on walls. He had fallen in love with a tree nymph, a hamadryad, and finally married her after a seemingly hopeless quest. Cyrus was jealous; he had no romantic prospects at all. At any rate, that explained Piper&#x2019;s nymphlike appearance: she was half nymph. <p></p>"What good are you?" Don asked. <p></p>"He&#x2019;s an ass&#x2014;I mean donkey," Cyrus said quickly. "He has barnyard manners. Ignore him." <p></p>"No, I&#x2019;ll answer," Piper said. "My talent is healing. That can be very useful. In fact I have a pet whirlwind I healed, Dusty." <p></p>"A useful whirlwind?" Don asked, his voice fairly rusting with sarcasm. <p></p>"Sure. I&#x2019;ll show you. What do you most need?" <p></p>"More dry wood. It&#x2019;s my fuel. I&#x2019;m a wood-burning robot ass." Don obviously thought he had stifled her positive attitude. <p></p>Piper put two fingers to her mouth and made an ungirl-like whistle. In a moment a whirling cloud of dust cruised in toward them, tossing leaves and small twigs about. "This is Dusty," she said as the whirlwind hovered beside her. "Dusty Dust Devil." <p></p>"What an ill wind," Don said. <p></p>The wind coalesced into a small horned creature. "Why thank you, asi <p></p>nine junk," the little devil said. Don took it in stride. "Can you bring me dry wood, you horny midget?" "Please," Piper said. "I&#x2019;ve got a feeling there&#x2019;s a bad word there." The devil disappeared, becoming the dust devil. It whirled all around <p></p>the glade and into the surrounding forest. In a moment it returned, filled with brush, and faded. A pile of dead branches fell to the ground as the devil formed. <p></p>Don stared. "That will hold me for three days!" He started chomping <p></p>wood. "Say thank you," Cyrus murmured to the donkey. "Why?" Don asked around a mouthful. Cyrus realized that politeness was not part of the animal&#x2019;s program. So he gave a reason that would make sense to a selfish creature. "Because you want to encourage him to do it again some time, after you run out of fuel." Don cocked an ear, understanding. "Thank you, Dusty." The little devil blushed blue. "Say you&#x2019;re welcome," Piper murmured. "You&#x2019;re welcome." Don paused in midchomp. He was coming to appreciate the possible <p></p>benefits of common courtesy. Piper smiled. She was pretty when she did that. "It&#x2019;s nice to see folk get along," she said. <p></p>Too bad she was only thirteen years old, according to Cyrus&#x2019;s data bank: too young to be a prospect for romance. Not that Cyrus knew anything about romance. <p></p>They had to wait while the donkey took in the pile of wood. "What are you doing here?" Cyrus asked the nymph. <p></p>"I&#x2019;m just widening my horizons," she said. "Every year mother lets me wander farther from the tree. By the time I&#x2019;m adult, I should be familiar with the whole area. Already today I met a man with the talent of selective friction: he can move anywhere, because if he&#x2019;s on slippery ice, he can make one foot have a lot of friction, and push with it, then change to the other foot." <p></p>"So what good is that?" Don asked. "There&#x2019;s no ice here." <p></p>"Maybe some day there&#x2019;ll be ice," Piper said. "Or something else that&#x2019;s slippery or soupy." <p></p>"What do you want to do when you are adult?" Cyrus asked, partly to stop the donkey from being obnoxious. But also because he did not know what he wanted to do, and perhaps she would give him an idea. <p></p>"I&#x2019;d like to be an actress, I think," she said. "To be in a play and have people watch me and applaud. I wouldn&#x2019;t even have to be famous. I&#x2019;d just like to be on stage." <p></p>That seemed like a curious ambition, but Cyrus&#x2019;s caution-circuit prevented him from saying so. "I hope you find your play." <p></p>"I hope so too." Piper looked around. "I&#x2019;d better get home; mother worries when I&#x2019;m out alone too long. She&#x2019;s afraid I&#x2019;ll run afoul of some strange man or something." <p></p>Like a cyborg? That, too, was worth not saying. "Tell her you met a robot donkey with asinine manners." <p></p>"I will," she said. "Come on, Dusty; I&#x2019;ll race you to the tree." <p></p>The little devil became the whirlwind. Dust devil and girl took off into the forest, racing each other. <p></p>Meanwhile Don had finished the pile of wood. His belly was full; it would, as he said, burn for three days, keeping him hot and active. <p></p>They wended their way back to the enchanted path. "You know, I&#x2019;d be able to eat faster and last longer if you&#x2019;d designed me to burn coal," Don said. <p></p>"Coal has to be mined. Wood&#x2019;s easier to get. Anyway, I had to use parts of wrecked robots, and they were all wood-burning." <p></p>"That also explains where you got my warped brain chip." <p></p>It did indeed. Cyrus was beginning to regret raiding that old battleground. But there hadn&#x2019;t seemed to be much alternative if he wanted to ride. <p></p>As the day waned they came to a camping area. There were pie trees galore, and a nice caterpillar tent. <p></p>As they approached the tent, a young woman emerged. She looked lean and aggressive. Could she be barbarian? <p></p>"Who the bleep are you?" she demanded. "This tent is mine; I got here first. Go away." <p></p>Cyrus sifted through his data banks. "Enchanted Path Camping Sites are open to all legitimate travelers," he said. "We are legitimate." <p></p>"What, you and that dumb ass?" <p></p>"I&#x2019;m an ass, but I&#x2019;m not dumb," Don said. "I&#x2019;m a smart ass. How smart is your ass, wench?" He eyed her posterior. <p></p>The woman stared, evidently taken aback, or at least paused in place. "You talk!" <p></p>"Let&#x2019;s exchange introductions," Cyrus said hastily. "I am Cyrus Cyborg, and this is Don, a robot donkey." <p></p>"He&#x2019;s got a bleeping potty mouth on him." <p></p>"Look who&#x2019;s talking, you bleeping tart." <p></p>Cyrus interposed again. "And you are?" <p></p>"Tess," she said aggressively. "Tess Tosterone. I have a problem." <p></p>Don opened his mouth. Cyrus hastily stuffed a scrounged piece of wood into it. "May we inquire what it is?" <p></p>"I&#x2019;m too pushy. They tell me I need S Trojan to fix it. But I don&#x2019;t know who or where or what he is, so I&#x2019;m irritable." <p></p>Cyrus&#x2019;s data bank sifted again. "Trojan is one name of the Night Stallion who runs the dream realm. The horse of a different color. But he doesn&#x2019;t have a first name." <p></p>"Then it must be someone else. What would I want with a horse? Your talking mule is bad enough. Now are you going to clear out of here and let me be?" <p></p>Don had chewed and swallowed the stick. "Listen, harridan&#x2014;" <p></p>Cyrus made another effort to settle things politely, though her attitude was both annoying and intriguing. "We feel we have equal rights to camp here, so we won&#x2019;t be moving on tonight. Why do you object to sharing?" <p></p>"Because you&#x2019;re a man," Tess said bluntly. "All you men want only one thing." <p></p>This interested him. "What is that?" <p></p>"Don&#x2019;t pretend you don&#x2019;t know, you jerk!" <p></p>"I&#x2019;m not pretending. I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m traveling to see the Good Magician. I hope he will tell me what I truly want." <p></p>Tess gazed at him, taking stock. "You&#x2019;re serious." <p></p>"I am a serious person, yes." <p></p>"And a cyborg." <p></p>"Yes." <p></p>"What&#x2019;s a cyborg?" <p></p>"I am a robot-human crossbreed, part alive, part machine. I am not sure in which category I best belong." She studied him. "You look completely human." "Yes, I am crafted to be, externally. But my bones are iron, and I have a memory bank and consciousness chip in my iron skull. I am programmed to have a human outlook. My parents assembled me carefully." "Actually, you&#x2019;re one handsome male specimen, with a perfect rough-hewn face, fairly wild hair, and nice muscles." "My mother is a barbarian. She likes that type." "She has good taste in men. Your appearance is appealing to women." "It is? I did not know." "And you really don&#x2019;t know what all men want." "True. The information may be in my data bank, but I need a more specific description to evoke it. If you know, I would appreciate it if you would tell me. It might save me a year&#x2019;s service with the Good Magician." Tess laughed, surprising him. "It might indeed. Very well, I will share the tent with you, and maybe by morning you will figure it out for yourself." "I doubt it. I&#x2019;m sure it would be simpler if you just told me." "Simpler, yes. More fun, no." Was she teasing him? Teasing was another human thing Cyrus did not properly understand. There were a number of things like that, that it seemed only experience and new information could clarify. At any rate, Tess seemed to have mellowed, so he didn&#x2019;t question it. Maybe she would tell him in the morning. <p></p>"I&#x2019;ll fetch something to eat," Cyrus said. "Maybe some of those lichens." <p></p>"Don&#x2019;t," she said. "Those aren&#x2019;t like-ens, they&#x2019;re dislike-ens. Eat one, and you&#x2019;ll be unfriendly until you find and eat a like-en to cancel it. I found out the hard way." <p></p>He might have guessed. "Thank you." <p></p>"The effect wears off eventually. But why complicate things?" <p></p>They foraged for pies and had a nice dinner while Don snoozed beside the pond. Tess was companionable, now that she had accepted him as legitimate, but she seemed privately amused about something. Cyrus suppressed his annoyance. <p></p>As night closed, Tess took charge, in the aggressive way she had. "There are two bunks in the tent. You take the left one, I&#x2019;ll take the right one. We&#x2019;ll wash up first." <p></p>"As you wish," he agreed. <p></p>"Not as you wish?" <p></p>"I am amenable to whatever normal procedure is. I admit to having had little experience. It is my first journey away from home." <p></p>"What, away from your mommy?" <p></p>There was something in her tone, but it seemed a fair question. "Yes. Hannah Barbarian." <p></p>"Just how old are you, cyborg?" <p></p>"As much as two years." <p></p>"Two years! You look grown!" <p></p>"I am grown. I was delivered as a grown-man kit, in a small cat-shaped box, with some assembly required. I understand that effort drove both my parents to distraction, but in the course of the following year they managed to assemble me, and here I am." <p></p>She gazed at him assessingly. "So are you grown, or a baby? Are you familiar with the Adult Conspiracy?" <p></p>"Yes, of course. It is in my data bank. It concerns the things that children must be shielded from, such as bad words and stork summoning. Naturally I honor it to the letter; it&#x2019;s in my programming." <p></p>"Have you ever seen a bare woman?" <p></p>"Oh, yes, there are pictures in my data bank." <p></p>"A real one." <p></p>"No. But I&#x2019;m sure I know the description." <p></p>She shook her head as if bemused. "This way." She walked to the pond. <p></p>He followed. "Actually my data indicates that strangers do not readily show their bodies in public, so perhaps I should wait in the tent until you are through." <p></p>"Stay." <p></p>"But then&#x2014;" He paused, for she had hauled off her shirt. She was somewhat leaner than the picture in his data bank, but it was clear that she was female. "I see." <p></p>"I&#x2019;ll bet. Strip, Cyrus." <p></p>"As you wish." Carefully he removed his shoes, shirt, and trousers. <p></p>"Well, you look mostly human," she said. <p></p>"I am nevertheless a composite, as I said. My bones may be iron, but my flesh is alive.

She spent the rest of her childhood and teen years happily roaming fantastical and terrible worlds, and vowed that someday she'd write a story combining swords, sorcery, and the ravenous undead. That story began with the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>Sea of Shadows</em> and continues with <em>Empire of Night</em>.</p><p>Armstrong's first works for teens were the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Darkest Powers and Darkness Rising trilogies. She lives in rural Ontario with her husband, three children, and far too many pets.</p>12 years earlier... <br> <br>Mommy forgot to warn the new baby-sitter about the basement. <br> <br>Chloe teetered on the top step, chubby hands reaching up to clutch both railings, her arms <br>shaking so much she could barely hang on. Her legs shook too, the Scooby Doo heads on her <br>slippers bobbing. Even her breath shook, puffing like she&#x2019;d been running. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe?&#x201d; Emily&#x2019;s muffled voice drifted up from the dark basement. &#x201c;Your mom said the <br>Coke&#x2019;s in the cold cellar, but I can&#x2019;t find it. Can you come down and help me?&#x201d; <br> <br>Mommy said she&#x2019;d told Emily about the basement. Chloe was sure of it. She closed her eyes <br>and thought hard. Before Mommy and Daddy left for the party, she&#x2019;d been playing in the TV <br>room. Mommy had called, and Chloe had run into the front hall where Mommy had scooped her <br>up in a hug, laughing when Chloe&#x2019;s doll poked her eye. <br> <br>&#x201c;I see you&#x2019;re playing with Princess&#x2013;I mean, Pirate Jasmine. Has she rescued poor Aladdin <br>from the evil genie yet?&#x201d; <br> <br>Chloe shook her head, then whispered. &#x201c;Did you tell Emily about the basement?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I most certainly did. No basements for Miss Chloe. That door stays closed.&#x201d; When Daddy <br>came around the corner, Mommy said, &#x201c;We really need to talk about moving, Steve.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Say the word and the sign goes up.&#x201d; Daddy ruffled Chloe&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;Be good for Emily, <br>kiddo.&#x201d; <br> <br>And then they were gone. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe, I know you can hear me,&#x201d; Emily yelled. <br> <br>Chloe peeled her fingers from the railing and stuck them in her ears. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe!&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I c-can&#x2019;t go down there,&#x201d; Chloe called. &#x201c;I-I&#x2019; m not allowed.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m in charge and I say you are. You&#x2019;re a big girl.&#x201d; <br> <br>Chloe made her feet move down one step. The back of her throat hurt and everything looked <br>fuzzy, like she was going to cry. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe Saunders, you have five seconds or I&#x2019;ll drag you down here and lock the door.&#x201d; <br> <br>Chloe raced down the steps so fast her feet tangled and she tumbled into a heap on the <br>landing. She lay there, ankle throbbing, tears burning her eyes as she peered into the basement, <br>with its creaks and smells and shadows. And Mrs. Hobb. <br> <br>There&#x2019;d been others, before Mrs. Hobb scared them away. Like old Mrs. Miller, who&#x2019;d play <br>peek-a-boo with Chloe and call her Mary. And Mr. Drake, who&#x2019;d ask weird questions like <br>whether anyone lived on the moon yet, and most times Chloe didn&#x2019;t know the answer, but he&#x2019;d <br>still smile and tell her she was a good girl. <br> <br>Chloe used to like coming downstairs and talking to the people. All she had to do was not <br>look behind the furnace, where a man hung from the ceiling, his face all purple and puffy. He <br>never said anything, but seeing him always made Chloe&#x2019;s tummy hurt. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe?&#x201d; Emily&#x2019;s muffled voice called. &#x201c;Are you coming?&#x201d; <br> <br>Mommy would say &#x201c;Think about the good parts, not the bad.&#x201d; So as Chloe walked down the <br>last three steps, she remembered Mrs. Miller and Mr. Drake and she didn&#x2019;t think about Mrs. <br>Hobb at all . . . or not very much. <br> <br>At the bottom, she squinted into the near darkness. Just the night lights were on, the ones <br>Mommy had put everywhere when Chloe started saying she didn&#x2019;t want to go downstairs and <br>Mommy thought she was afraid of the dark, which she was, a little, but only because the dark <br>meant Mrs. Hobb could sneak up on her. <br> <br>Chloe could see the cold cellar door, though, so she kept her eyes on that and walked as fast <br>as she could. When something moved, she forgot about not looking, but it was only the hanging <br>man, and all she could see was his hand peeking from behind the furnace as he swayed. <br> <br>Chloe ran to the cold cellar door and yanked it open. Inside, it was pitch black. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe?&#x201d; Emily called from the darkness. <br> <br>Chloe clenched her fists. Now Emily was being really mean. Hiding on her&#x2013; <br>Footsteps pattered overhead. Mommy? Home already? <br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Chloe. You aren&#x2019;t afraid of the dark, are you?&#x201d; Emily laughed. &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re <br>still a little baby after all.&#x201d; <br> <br>Chloe scowled. Emily didn&#x2019;t know anything. Just a stupid, mean girl. Chloe would get her <br>Coke, then run upstairs and tell Mommy, and Emily would never baby-sit her again. <br> <br>She leaned into the tiny room, trying to remember where Mommy kept the Coke. That was it <br>on the shelf, wasn&#x2019;t it? She darted over, and stood on her tiptoes. Her fingers closed around a <br>cool metal can. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe? Chloe!&#x201d; It was Emily&#x2019;s voice, but far away, shrill. Footsteps pounded across the <br>floor overhead. &#x201c;Chloe, where are you?&#x201d; <br> <br>Chloe dropped the can. It hit the concrete with a crack, then rolled against her foot, hissing <br>and spitting, soda pooling around her slippers. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe, Chloe, where are you?&#x201d; mimicked a voice behind her, like Emily&#x2019;s, but not quite. <br> <br>Chloe turned slowly. <br> <br>In the doorway stood an old woman in a pink housecoat, her eyes and teeth glittering in the <br>dark. Mrs. Hobb. Chloe wanted to squeeze her eyes shut, but she didn&#x2019;t dare because it only <br>made her madder, made everything worse. <br> <br>Mrs. Hobb&#x2019;s skin rippled and squirmed. Then it went black and shiny, crackling like twigs <br>in a campfire. Big chunks fell off, plopping onto the floor. Her hair sizzled and burned away. <br>And then there was nothing left but a skull dotted with scraps of blackened flesh. The jaws <br>opened, the teeth still glittering. <br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome back, Chloe.&#x201d; <br> <br>One <br> <br>I bolted up in bed, one hand clutching my pendant, the other wrapped in my sheets. I struggled to <br>recapture wisps of the dream already fluttering away. Something about a basement . . . A little <br>girl . . . Me? I couldn&#x2019;t remember ever having a basement&#x2013;we&#x2019;d always lived in condo <br>apartments. <br> <br>A little girl in a basement, something scary . . . Weren&#x2019;t basements always scary? I shivered <br>just thinking about them, dark and damp and empty. But this one hadn&#x2019;t been empty. There&#x2019;d <br>been . . . I couldn&#x2019;t remember what. A man behind a furnace . . .? <br> <br>A bang at my bedroom door made me jump. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe!&#x201d; Annette shrieked. &#x201c;Why hasn&#x2019;t your alarm gone off? I&#x2019;m the housekeeper, not <br>your nanny. If you&#x2019;re late again, I&#x2019;m calling your father.&#x201d; <br> <br>As threats went, this wasn&#x2019;t exactly the stuff of nightmares. Even if Annette managed to get <br>hold of my dad in Berlin, he&#x2019;d just pretend to listen, eyes on his BlackBerry, attention riveted to <br>something more important, like the weather forecast. He&#x2019;d murmur a vague &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ll see to it <br>when I get back&#x201d; and forget all about me the moment he hung up. <br> <br>I turned on my radio, cranked it up, and crawled out of bed. <br> <br>A half-hour later, I was in my bathroom, getting ready for school. I pulled the sides of my hair <br>back in clips, glanced in the mirror, and shuddered. The style made me look twelve years old . . . <br>and I didn&#x2019;t need any help. I&#x2019;d just turned fifteen and servers still handed me the kiddie menu in <br>restaurants. I couldn&#x2019;t blame them. I was five foot nothing with curves that only showed if I wore <br>tight jeans and a tighter T-shirt. <br> <br>Aunt Lauren swore I&#x2019;d shoot up&#x2013;and out&#x2013;when I finally got my period. By this point, I <br>figured it was &#x201c;if,&#x201d; not &#x201c;when.&#x201d; Most of my friends had gotten theirs at twelve, eleven even. I <br>tried not to think about it too much, but of course I did. I worried that there was something <br>wrong with me, felt like a freak every time my friends talked about their periods, prayed they <br>didn&#x2019; t find out I hadn&#x2019;t gotten mine. Aunt Lauren said I was fine, and she was a doctor, so I <br>guess she&#x2019;d know. But it still bugged me. A lot. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chloe!&#x201d; The door shuddered under Annette&#x2019;s meaty fist. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on the toilet,&#x201d; I shouted back. &#x201c;Can I get some privacy maybe?&#x201d; <br> <br>I tried just one clip at the back of my head, holding the sides up. Not bad. When I turned my <br>head for a side view, the clip slid from my baby-fine hair. <br> <br>I never should have gotten it cut. But I&#x2019;d been sick of having long, straight, little-girl hair. I&#x2019;d <br>decided on a shoulder-length, wispy style. On the model it looked great. On me? Not so much. <br>I eyed the unopened hair color tube. Kari swore red streaks would be perfect in my <br>strawberry-blond hair. I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking I&#x2019;d look like a candy cane. Still, it might make <br>me look older . . . <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m picking up the phone, Chloe,&#x201d; Annette yelled. <br> <br>I grabbed the tube of dye, stuffed it in my backpack, and threw open the door. <br> <br>I took the stairs, as always. The building might change, but my routine never did. The day I&#x2019;d <br>started kindergarten, my mother held my hand, my Sailor Moon backpack over her other arm as <br>we&#x2019;d stood at the top of the landing. <br> <br>&#x201c;Get ready, Chloe,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;One, two, three&#x2013;&#x201d; <br> <br>And we were off, racing down the stairs until we reached the bottom, panting and giggling, <br>the floor swaying and sliding under our unsteady feet, all the fears over my first school day gone. <br>We&#x2019;d run down the stairs together every morning all though kindergarten and half of first <br>grade and then . . . well, then there wasn&#x2019;t anyone to run down the stairs with anymore. <br> <br>I paused at the bottom, touching the necklace under my T-shirt, then shook off the memories, <br>hoisted my backpack, and walked from the stairwell. <br> <br>After my mom died, we&#x2019;d moved around Buffalo a lot. My dad flipped luxury apartments, <br>meaning he bought them in buildings in the final stages of construction, then sold them when the <br>work was complete. Since he was away on business most of the time, putting down roots wasn&#x2019;t <br>important. Not for him, anyway. <br> <br>This morning, the stairs hadn&#x2019;t been such a bright idea. My stomach was already fluttering <br>with nerves over my Spanish midterm. I&#x2019;d screwed up the last test&#x2013;gone to a weekend <br>sleepover at Beth&#x2019;s when I should have been studying&#x2013;and barely passed. Spanish had never <br>been my best subject, but if I didn&#x2019;t pull it up to a C, Dad might actually notice and start <br>wondering whether an art school had been such a smart choice. <br> <br>Milos was waiting for me in his cab at the curb. He&#x2019;d been driving me for two years now, <br>through two moves and three schools. As I got in, he adjusted the visor on my side. The morning <br>sun still hit my eyes, but I didn&#x2019;t tell him that. <br> <br>My stomach relaxed as I rubbed my fingers over the familiar rip in the armrest and inhaled <br>chemical pine from the air freshener twisting above the vent. <br> <br>&#x201c;I saw a movie last night,&#x201d; he said as he slid the cab across three lanes. &#x201c;One of the kind you <br>like.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;A thriller?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He frowned, lips moving as if testing out word choices. &#x201c;An action-adventure. You <br>know, lots of guns, things blowing up. A real shoot-&#x2019;em-down movie.&#x201d; <br> <br>I hated correcting Milos&#x2019; s English, but he insisted on it. &#x201c;You mean, a shoot-&#x2019;em-up movie.&#x201d; <br> <br>He cocked one dark brow. &#x201c;When you shoot a man, which way does he fall? Up?&#x201d; <br> <br>I laughed, and we talked about movies for a while. My favorite subject. <br> <br>When Milos had to take a call from his dispatcher, I glanced out the side window. A <br>long-haired boy darted from behind a cluster of businessmen. He carried an old-fashioned plastic <br>lunch box with a superhero on it. I was so busy trying to figure out which superhero it was, I <br>didn&#x2019; t notice where the boy was headed until he leaped off the curb, landing between us and the <br>next car. <br> <br>&#x201c;Milos!&#x201d; I screamed. &#x201c;Watch&#x2013;&#x201d; <br> <br>The last word was ripped from my lungs as I slammed against my shoulder belt. The driver <br>behind us, and the one behind him, laid on their horns, a chain reaction of protest. <br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Milos said. &#x201c;Chloe? What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; <br> <br>I looked over the hood of the car and saw . . . nothing. Just an empty lane in front and traffic <br>veering to our left, drivers flashing Milos the finger as they passed. <br> <br>&#x201c;Th-th-th&#x2013;&#x201d; I clenched my fists, as if that could somehow force the word out. If you get <br>jammed, take another route, my speech therapist always said. &#x201c;I thought I saw <br>some-wha-wha&#x2013;&#x201d; <br> <br>Speak slowly. Consider your words first. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I thought I saw someone jump in front of us.&#x201d; <br> <br>Milos eased the taxi forward. &#x201c;That happens to me sometimes, especially if I&#x2019;m turning my <br>head. I think I see someone, but there&#x2019;s no one there.&#x201d; <br> <br>I nodded. My stomach hurt again.</p><h2>Blood Bond 14: Moonshine Massacre</h2><p>A half-breed and a white man.

Collected within this edition are 81 paintings from these years, accompanied with a fascinating narrative on Monet&#39;s life, loves, and influences.

Celebrated historian David Kynaston has written an utterly original, compellingly readable account of the following six years, during which the country indomitably rebuilt itself. </p><p>Kynaston's great genius is to chronicle England's experience from bottom to top: coursing through the book, therefore, is an astonishing variety of ordinary, contemporary voices, eloquently and passionately displaying the country's remarkable spirit even as they were unaware of what the future would hold. Together they present a fascinating portrait of the English people at a climactic point in history, and Kynaston skillfully links their stories to the bigger, headline-making events of the time. Their stories also jostle alongside those of more well-known figures like celebrated journalist-to-be Jon Arlott (making his first radio broadcast), actress Glenda Jackson, and writer Doris Lessing, newly arrived from Africa and struck by the leveling poverty of postwar Britain. <i>Austerity Britain</i> gives new meaning to the hardship and heroism experienced by England in the face of Germany's assaults.</p></p><p><p><b>David Kynaston</b> was widely acclaimed for his four-volume history <i>The City of London</i>. He is currently a visiting professor at Kingston University in England.</p><p>&#x201c;Exemplary social history of a time still fresh in many Britons' minds--and much different from the postwar era in America.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;By combining astute political analysis with illustrative anecdotes brilliantly chosen from contemporary newspapers, popular culture and memoirs, Kynaston succeeds in recreating the lost world of austerity. The volume represents social history at its finest, and readers may look forward to its promised sequels taking the story of Britain up to 1979 and the election of Margaret Thatcher.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An engrossing, kaleidoscopic portrait of a people from a particular time and place. This is history as total immersion.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Barry Gewen, New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;This sparkling book--deeply and imaginatively researched, written with bounce, and informed by the wryest sensibility--charts the evolution of British society during the depleted and dingy years 1945&#x2013;1951....With wit and ingenuity, Kynaston mines opinion surveys, radio shows, advertising slogans, parliamentary reports, and above all letters, diaries, and memoirs to evoke the gray tinge that permeated postwar life--the shabby frocks, the sallow faces, the grubby train compartments, the dreary meals ("all winter greens and root vegetables and hamburgers made of grated potato and oatmeal and just a little meat," the food writer Marguerite Patten recalled). ...Kynaston's sense of structure and pacing is sure, his mastery of his astonishingly diverse material unfailing (see his opening set piece on VE Day). More vividly and penetratingly than any work of history I can recall, this book captures the rhythms and texture of everyday life. To read it is to enter a world, which helps explain why it became a surprise best seller in the U.K.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Benjamin Schwarz, Atlantic Monthly</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Austerity Britain</i>, David Kynaston weaves together personal reminiscences, statistical data and media accounts to paint a portrait of this critical moment in British history...Most histories describe this period as one of idealism, hope and progress. Mr. Kynaston would not entirely disagree, but he wants to emphasize what is too often overlooked: the sheer difficulty of life in Britain between 1945 and 1951. He shows us a war-weary society weighed down by the burdens of austerity. He brings to life a world &#x2013; it wasn't so long ago &#x2013; noticeably unaided by the conveniences and prosperity that Britain (like the rest of the West) now takes for granted.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>William Anthony Hay, Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Austerity Britain: 1945-1951</i>, British social historian David Kynaston tells the story of those drab, difficult postwar years so familiar to viewers of the stiff-upper-lip, black-and-white films the British studios were turning out at the time (&#x2018;Brief Encounter,' &#x2018;Passport to Pimlico'). Reading the many first-person accounts in this weighty, immensely detailed and sometimes evocative volume, you begin to see that, for countless people in that place at that time, life really was lived in a world devoid of color -- a place of long lines, of shortages, of frustration.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Martin Rubin, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely masterful and absorbing, helped considerably by the liberal use of feedback from the vox pop through diaries, opinion polls, newspapers and broadcast reports...England was old and not very merry, a state of affairs conveyed with brilliant clarity and poignant depth in Austerity Britain.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jonathan E. Lazarus, Newark Star Ledger</i></p></p><h2>Doctor Sleep</h2><p>Stephen King returns to the character and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, <i>The Shining</i>, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance and the very special twelve-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.<b> </b><br><br>On highways across America, a tribe of people called the True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless&#x2014;mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, the True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the steam that children with the shining produce when they are slowly tortured to death.<br> <br>Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel, where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father&#x2019;s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant shining power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes &#x201c;Doctor Sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan&#x2019;s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra&#x2019;s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of <i>The Shining</i> and satisfy anyone new to this icon in the King canon.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2013:</strong> What ever happened to Danny Torrance? For the 36 years since <em>The Shining</em> was first published, the answer has been left to our imaginations. Finally we catch up with Dan as his creator envisions him: a flawed middle-aged man with a tragic past -- his special gift, "shining," dulled with age and alcohol. He's "Doctor Sleep" now, a hospice worker who eases the end of patients' lives. He also happens to be the only one who can help a little girl with her own special gift. This is not simply <em>The Shining II</em>. Not only does this story stand on its own, it manages to magnify the supernatural quality that first drew us to young Danny, expanding its mystery and its intensity in a way that might even reach beyond this book into the rest of the King-iverse... and beyond.

We ve set the standard that every map company has imitated but never duplicated. Our mission is to make you feel comfortable, to make you feel safe in a place where you ve never been before and to enable you to experience a familiar place more fully.<p>The company was founded in 1984 by Michael Brown, who had been in international publishing for many years, setting up subsidiaries for textbook publishers. In the 1970 s, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving.</p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain.</p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool.</p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package.</p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work. More titles were added, each title requiring months of research and design.</p><p>Today, STREETWISE� produces over 130 titles for major destinations, regions and countries throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. We have grown from the back of a motorcycle to selling millions of maps around the world.</p><p>Yet each title is still painstakingly researched and updated. STREETWISE� is one of the only, if not THE only map company that conducts research by walking or driving an area to ensure accuracy. After all, what good is the map if what you hold in your hands doesn t match what you see on the street sign? This lengthy fact checking results in superior accuracy; in effect, we ve done the work, now you have the adventure.</p><p>In the end, it s not about the map, it s about getting out and finding your own authentic experience wherever you go. It s about being in a city or a region and discovering things that you never thought you would find. You can do this if you have confidence and you have confidence if you have a great map. STREETWISE� is the great map that you need.</p>'In a strange city, your sense of direction is only as good as the map in your hands.

But beware of investment strategies that are easy but don't offer the chance to really learn about investing. Mutual funds, banks, and some brokers often want to lock your money into buy-and-hold schemes or, worse, to trade excessively and churn up fees.

A core lesson for anyone wanting financial control, this is the best ever and most personal example of Rich Dad's financial wisdom, regardless of your current job or how much you have to invest.

If you're in a big truck, they're around you like gnats. They're at their worst in the on-ramps of limited-access highways, not to mention what they do on horse-and-buggy highways. They do the kissing tailgate. They do passing moves over double yellow lines. They make last-second break-ins from stop signs on feeder roads. The way they are operated suggests insufficiency in, among other things, co�rdination, depth perception, and rhythm. When I went to bad-driver school, the opening lecturer did not imply any such flaws in his students. He was a real bear. He wore blue-and-yellow trousers and a badge. In a voice he fired like a .45, he began by asking us, "How many of you people think you're good drivers?" <br>&nbsp; <br>We had all been singled out in four-wheelers. My own car had a tendency to ignore stop signs without previously sensing the presence of bears. It lapsed in other ways as well. After I reached twelve points, I was offered admission to the New Jersey Driver Improvement Program, on the following voluntary basis: enroll or lose your license. Among the twenty-five people in the class, two smart-asses stuck up their hands in positive response to the instructor's question. He looked them over, then swept the room. "Well, you must all be good drivers," he said. "If you weren't, you'd be dead." <br>&nbsp; <br>Then he darkened the room and rolled a film showing cars hitting cars in on-ramps. A, looking left, accelerates. B, looking left, accelerates. B rear-ends A, because A hesitated, and B was still looking to the left. This primal accident, the figure eight of bad driving, was the base of a graphic montage that ended in high-speed collision and hideous death on the road. <br>&nbsp; <br>These memories of bad-driver school ran through me in eastern Oregon after Don Ainsworth, at the wheel of his sixty-five-foot chemical tanker, gave some air horn to a step van that was coming fast up an on-ramp on a vector primed for a crash. A step van is a walk-in vehicle of the UPS variety, and, like all other four-wheelers, from Jettas to Jaguars, in Ainsworth's perspective is not a truck. FedEx, Wonder Bread, Soprano Sand-and-Gravel--they're not trucks, they're four-wheelers, even if they have six wheels. A true truck has eighteen wheels, or more. From Atlanta and Charlotte to North Powder, Oregon, this was the first time that Ainsworth had so much as tapped his air horn. In the three thousand one hundred and ninety miles I rode with him he used it four times. He gave it a light, muted blast to thank a woman in a four-wheeler who helped us make a turn in urban traffic close to our destination, and he used it twice in the Yakima Valley, flirting with a woman who was wearing a bikini. She passed us on I-82, and must have pulled over somewhere, because she passed us again on I-90. She waved both times the horn erupted. She was riding in a convertible and her top was down. <br>&nbsp; <br>If the step van had hit us it would only have been inconvenient, the fact notwithstanding that we were hauling hazmats. The step van weighed about ten thousand pounds and we weighed eighty thousand pounds, minus a few ounces. Ainsworth said he could teach a course called On-Ramp 101. "We get many near-misses from folks who can't time their entry. They give you the finger. Women even give you the finger. Can you believe it?" <br>&nbsp; <br>I could believe it. <br>&nbsp; <br>"Four-wheelers will pass us and then pull in real fast and put on their brakes for no apparent reason," he said. "Four-wheelers are not aware of the danger of big trucks. They're not aware of the weight, of how long it takes to bring one to a halt, how quickly their life can be snuffed. If you pull any stunts around the big trucks, you're likely to die. I'm not going to die. You are." <br>&nbsp; <br>We happened to be approaching Deadman Pass. We were crossing the Blue Mountains--on I-84, the Oregon Trail. He said, "Before you know it, we'll be sitting on top of Cabbage. Then we're going to fall down." He had mentioned Cabbage Hill when we were still in the Great Divide Basin. He mentioned it again in Pocatello. After crossing into Oregon and drawing closer, he brought it up twice an hour. "It's the terrific hill we fall down before we come to Pendleton. Pretty treacherous. Switchbacks. Speed restricted by weight. You'll see guys all the time with smoke flying out the brakes or even a flameout at the bottom." <br>&nbsp; <br>From the Carolina piedmont to Hot Lake, Oregon--across the Appalachians, across the Rockies--he had not put his foot on the brake pedal on any descending grade. In harmony with shrewd gear selection, this feat was made possible by Jake Brakes--a product of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, of Bloomfield, Connecticut. Ainsworth called the device "a retarder, generically--you're turning a diesel engine into an air compressor." On a grade we descended in Tennessee, he said, "If you choose your gear right, and your jake's on maxi, you can go down a hill with no brakes. It saves money. It also lengthens my life." Crossing the summit of the Laramie Range and addressing the western side, he geared down from twelfth to eighth and said, "I won't use one ounce of brake pressure. The jake is on maxi." As big trucks flew past us--dry boxes, reefers--he said, "These guys using brakes with improper gear selection don't own the tractor or the trailer. Using brakes costs money, but why would they care?" Ainsworth owns the tractor and the trailer. As he glided onto the Laramie Plains, he went back up to eighteenth gear: "the going- home gear, the smoke hole; when you got into this gear in the old days, your stacks would blow smoke." On a grade at Hot Lake, however, he tried fifteenth gear, and his foot had to graze the pedal. He seemed annoyed with himself, like a professional golfer who had chosen the wrong club. <br>&nbsp; <br>And now we were about to "fall down Cabbage." In ten miles, we would drop two thousand feet, six of those miles on a six-per-cent grade. Through basaltic throughcuts we approached the brink. A sign listed speed limits by weight. If you weighed sixty thousand to sixty-five thousand pounds, your limit was thirty-seven miles an hour. In five-thousand-pound increments, speed limits went down to twenty-six and twenty-two. Any vehicle weighing seventy-five thousand pounds or more--e.g., this chemical tanker--was to go eighteen or under. A huge high view with Pendleton in it suddenly opened up. I had asked Ainsworth what makes a tractor-trailer jackknife. He had said, "You're going downhill. The trailer is going faster than the tractor. The trailer takes over. It's almost impossible to bring yourself out of it. Brakes won't do anything for you. It's a product of going too fast for the situation. It can happen on a flat highway, but nine times out of ten it's downhill." The escarpment was so steep that the median widened from a few feet to one and a half miles as the northbound and southbound lanes negotiated independent passage. Ainsworth had chosen eighth gear. He said, "Most truckers would consider this way too conservative. That doesn't mean they're bright." Oregon is the only American state in which trucks are speed-restricted by weight. Feet off both pedals, he started the fall down Cabbage praising the truck for "good jake" and himself for "nice gear selection." My ears thickened and popped. <br>&nbsp; <br>"Six per cent is serious," he said. "I've seen some sevens or eights. British Columbia drivers talk about tens and twelves." <br>&nbsp; <br>In two strategic places among the broad looping switchbacks were escape ramps, also known as arrester beds, where a brakeless runaway truck--its driver "mashing the brake pedal and it feels like a marshmallow"--could leave the road and plow up a very steep incline on soft sandy gravel. In winter, the gravel may not be soft. Ainsworth recalled a trucker in Idaho who hit a frozen ramp. His load, bursting through from behind, removed his head. On Cabbage Hill, deep fresh tracks went up an arrester bed several hundred feet. After trucks use a bed, it has to be re- groomed. The state charges grooming fees. Some drivers, brakeless and out of control, stay on the highway and keep on plunging because they don't want to pay the grooming fees. Ainsworth said, "Would you worry about your life or the God- damned grooming fee?" <br>&nbsp; <br>He was asking the wrong person. <br>&nbsp; <br>A little later, he said, "Bears will roost at the bottom here." <br>&nbsp; <br>Fulfilling the prediction, two cars were in ambush in the median where the grade met the plain. Wheat fields filled the plain--endless leagues of wheat, big combines moving through the wheat, houses far out in the wheat concealed within capsules of trees. We passed a couple of dry boxes, both of them Freightliners. Among truckers, they are also known as Freightshakers. "What's the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and the door on a Freightliner?" Ainsworth said. <br>&nbsp; <br>I said I didn't happen to know. <br>&nbsp; <br>He said, "You can close a door on a Jehovah's Witness." <br>&nbsp; <br>We crossed the Columbia River and went over the Horse Heaven Hills into the Yakima Valley, apples and grapes in the Horse Heaven Hills, gators in the valley. To avoid a gator he swung far right, over rumble bars along the shoulder. A gator is a strip of tire, dead on the road, nearly always a piece of a recap. "A gator can rip off your fuel-crossover line, punch in your bumper, bomb out a fender." <br>&nbsp; <br>The Yakima River was deeply incised and ran in white water past vineyards and fruit trees, among windbreaks of Lombardy poplars. Hops were growing on tall poles and dangling like leis. There was so much beauty in the wide valley it could have been in Italy. Now, through high haze, we first saw the Cascades. On our route so far, no mountain range had been nearly as impressive. We had slithered over the R...</p><h2>West Of The West</h2><p><p>Teddy Roosevelt once exclaimed, &#x201c;When I am in California, I am not in the West.

You'd figure that a writer trying to bag California would grab for the big guns and shoot directly at the Golden State's most glaring issues and overarching themes. But Arax has done exactly the opposite. He has decided to capture minor characters, moments and conflicts and dig deep within them, evidently hoping that the minutiae of any given tale will tell us something significant about the twisted soul of this giant state. What Arax's essays ultimately do is take us on a series of extended field trips. There's the idealistic organic dairy farmer whose milk may have poisoned children, the cancer-stricken immigrant Armenian restaurant owner who murdered his sister and mother, the retired FBI agent who thinks the government is railroading a Pakistani American terror suspect, a kid named Redwood who lived for months high up in an oak grove on the Berkeley campus so the university couldn't cut the trees down. Arax successfully evades the usual tropes about California being the land of either dreams or nightmares. Instead, his essays paint an impressionistic landscape of a land of frustration. In the first paragraph of the first chapter, Arax mentions that he's recently divorced. A few pages later, he writes that after leaving his job at the Los Angeles Times, he found himself sifting through old notebooks and finding old friends. As I read his essays, I sometimes imagined the writer wading through these notebooks late at night, perhaps with a beer in hand, trying to stitch together a coherent narrative of a life that had gone off course. In the epilogue, we learn about the tragedy that makes Arax tick, the horrible event that honed his investigative skills as a journalist. When Mark was 15 years old, his father, Ara Arax, was murdered. Decades later, out of a compulsion to solve his father's murder, he spent seven years writing a book on the subject. This is what Mark Arax does: He investigates and parses tragedy and weaves a coherent tale around it. This, it appears, is what he's compelled to do. But the problem with these essays is that they presume to be much more than investigative reporting. Arax tries to tease poetic and sometimes political significance out of what are essentially short, well-reported vignettes, and sometimes he tries too hard. "Strange as it sounds," he writes at one point, "the war on terror and the war in Iraq were playing out with a particular intensity in the raisin capital of the world." Is it just my Southern Californian bias, or is it hard to imagine Fresno -- Arax's hometown -- as being the provincial epicenter of post-9/11 America? Desperate to find meaning in the details, Arax can produce trite commentary in breathless prose. Musing on the decline of social activism since the 1960s, he says, "I only knew that when I strolled across People's Park and onto the Berkeley campus and finally found the steps of Sproul Hall, there wasn't one man raging to thousands about throwing his body onto the gears of the machine but thousands, en masse, heedless, staring into the iridescence of their cell phones." At its best, "West of the West" is a jumble of colorful moments and characters, but if it was California that Arax was after, the bear got away. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Originally published in 1992, it was Thom Gunn's first book of verse in ten years.<br></p><p>In the title poem of Thom Gunn's <i>The Man with Night Sweats</i>, the speaker wakes from a nightmare of "mind reduced to hurry" and "flesh reduced and wrecked." In this haunting prelude to his laments for friends lost to AIDS, he explores his own body for damage, and concludes, <blockquote> Hugging my body to me<br> As if to shield it from<br> The pains that will go through me,<br> <p> As if hands were enough<br> To hold an avalanche off.<br> </p></blockquote> As this avalanche of tragedy begins to slide down the hills of Gunn's adopted San Francisco, the poems themselves change form. They cascade from the elegiac couplets of "The J Car," about the decline of a gym owner, into the harrowing free verse of "In Time of Plague," in which the speaker remembers being too "afraid of the strength / of my own health" to indulge with "Brad and John, these fiercely attractive men / who want me to stick their needle in my arm." Gunn's understated emotional weariness is especially compelling when read alongside the book's many songs of innocence. The simple "Seesaw," for example, provides an <i>ars poetica</i> that applies equally to life: "So it ends / as it begins. / Off we climb / And no one wins." Although the specter of plague stands behind much of the book, he maintains the tense prosodic trajectory he's followed since 1954's <i>Fighting Terms</i>. His long California residency aside, Gunn writes the best British poetry of his generation, and <i>The Man with Night Sweats</i> is his finest book to date. <i>--Edward Skoog</i>Thom Gunn was born in Gravesend, Kent in 1929. He published his first book of poems, Fighting Terms (1954), while he was still an undergraduate at Cambridge. That same year, he moved to California and stayed there for the rest of his life, teaching at Berkeley and living in San Francisco. He published nine books of poetry, including The Man with Night Sweats, which won the Forward Prize for Poetry in 1992, and Boss Cupid (2000). Gunn also published a Collected Poems (1994) and two collections of essays, The Occasions of Poetry (1982) and Shelf Life (1993). He was awarded many major prizes and fellowships from the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation.

Only two things are required: a satisfying, well-structured whodunit plot and a knack for rendering Austen&#39;s style at picking up the most delicate nuances in social behavior. Stephanie Barron succeeds on both counts. When the squire of a country manor in Hertfordshire is found lifeless in his bed, foul play is suspected and Jane is called upon to unravel the mystery. Along the way, Barron employs Jane as the first-person narrator and adeptly re-creates Austen&#39;s voice and delightfully subtle humor.Jane Austen wrote: "I would rather spend two minutes among the notorious than an hour with the dull." <p></p><p>Little did Miss Austen know how far from dull would be her visit to the snowy Hertfordshire estate of her young and beautiful friend, Isobel, the newly married Countess of Scargrave. Fleeing from a broken engagement, Jane has scarcely arrived at Scargrave when the Earl--a gentleman of mature years--is felled by a mysterious ailment that is far too agonizing--and fatal--to be credited to his fondness for claret and pudding. And the bereaved widow soon finds that her husband's death is only the beginning of her misfortunes as she becomes the recipient of a sinister and threatening missive that accuses her and her late husband's heir of being lovers--and murderers. When Isobel begs her friend Jane for help, Jane finds herself embroiled in an investigation that hinges on the motives of a great many people ensconced at Scargrave Manor. </p><p></p><p>A missing locket, a monogrammed handkerchief, an ancestral ghost, and the deadly fruit of a tropical tree are among the markers of a trail that will lead all the way to the House of Lords and Newgate Prison--and marks the sleuthing debut of a mystery series filled with the exquisite wit and powers of perception that could only belong to one woman.

As divorce rates climb to all-time highs, many couples, including Christians, question the role of marriage and its &#x201c;lifetime&#x201d; commitment. In <i>The Marriage Masterpiece,</i> Al Janssen looks at evidence of God's original intent for marriage, offers scriptural answers as to why marriage is still relevant, and paints a picture of what that means to couples today.</p><p></p><h2>California Rancho Cooking: Mexican and Californian Recipes</h2><p>Jacqueline Higuera McMahan's personal history as an eighth-generation Californian adds spice to this sumptuous celebration of the first fusion food.&#x201d; The recipes, blending Spanish, Mexican, and Californian cuisine, include Butterflied Lamb in Pomegranate Juice, Adobado (Chile-Soaked Pork or Spareribs), Grilled Trout Wrapped in Fig Leaves, and Strawberry Enchiladas with Sweet Milk Tortillas. With dozens of accompanying photographs in this collection of earthy yet sophisticated recipes of old California, McMahan also shares early California lore and memories of family meals.</p><p>California cuisine--with its goat cheese, arugula, and free-range chickens--took the culinary world by storm in the 1980s and '90s, but as Jacqueline Higuera McMahan shows us, "Rancho cooking" may be the original California cuisine. Descended from early Spanish settlers--known as the Californios--McMahan comes from a culinary tradition that spans backward through the gold rush and the missions to Mexico and Spain. In <i>Rancho Cooking</i> she tells the tale of the Californios' cuisine, and of her own family, through stories and recipes handed down for generations. <p> "Chiles are in our blood, my grandmother told me," McMahan writes, "I pictured rivers of dark chile flowing in our veins." That river of chiles flows not only in the veins of the Higueras, but throughout the history of cooking in California. Beginning with the Spaniards who, by necessity, borrowed culinary traditions from everyone from the Moors to the Indians, and merging with Mexican food drawn from Aztec and other Indian culinary traditions, Rancho cooking evolved as it was carried north through the Spanish territories in California. The Spanish brought with them their favorite foods--tomatoes, squash, pumpkins, corn, and of course chiles, to name a few--and the settlers perfected the art of barbecuing, which was so well suited to their outdoor lifestyle.</p> <p> What will strike readers first about this book is that the cooking represented is a far cry from the typical Mexican fare we're used to. This food has a sophistication far beyond smashed beans and rice. Olives, figs, fresh herbs, squash blossoms, and pumpkins appear with surprising regularity, and olive oil, not lard, is the fat of choice for cooking. Of course you'll also find many of the dishes that we think of as standard Mexican fare--enchiladas, tamales, quesadillas--but all have a distinctly Rancho touch. Enchiladas are filled with seafood and napped with a velvety tomato-chipotle sauce, quesadillas are stuffed with squash blossoms and <i>epazote</i> leaves, and tamale dough gets extra flavor from olive oil in addition to the usual lard.</p> <p> As much a history book as a cookbook, <i>Rancho Cooking</i> belongs on the shelf of anyone who calls him- or herself a connoisseur of California cuisine. <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p>Jacqueline Higuera McMahan is an eighth generation Californian whose family arrived in California in 1775 and lived on one of the last Spanish land grant ranchos. McMahan is the author of six cookbooks, including <i>California Rancho Cooking</i> and <i>The Salsa Cookbook</i> (both from Olive Press), and writes the "South to North" column for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>.

But now that she's made it out of the bloody arena alive, she's still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. And what's worse, President Snow has made it clear that no one else is safe either. Not Katniss's family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne Collins's groundbreaking <i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.<br> <br> <br> <p><b>A Q&amp;A with Suzanne Collins, Author of <i>Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)</i></b><br> </p><p></p> <b>Q:</b> You have said from the start that The Hunger Games story was intended as a trilogy. Did it actually end the way you planned it from the beginning? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Very much so. While I didn't know every detail, of course, the arc of the story from gladiator game, to revolution, to war, to the eventual outcome remained constant throughout the writing process. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> We understand you worked on the initial screenplay for a film to be based on <i>The Hunger Games</i>. What is the biggest difference between writing a novel and writing a screenplay?<p></p> <b>A:</b> There were several significant differences. Time, for starters. When you're adapting a novel into a two-hour movie you can't take everything with you. The story has to be condensed to fit the new form. Then there's the question of how best to take a book told in the first person and present tense and transform it into a satisfying dramatic experience. In the novel, you never leave Katniss for a second and are privy to all of her thoughts so you need a way to dramatize her inner world and to make it possible for other characters to exist outside of her company. Finally, there's the challenge of how to present the violence while still maintaining a PG-13 rating so that your core audience can view it. A lot of things are acceptable on a page that wouldn't be on a screen. But how certain moments are depicted will ultimately be in the director's hands. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> Are you able to consider future projects while working on <i>The Hunger Games</i>, or are you immersed in the world you are currently creating so fully that it is too difficult to think about new ideas?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I have a few seeds of ideas floating around in my head but--given that much of my focus is still on <i>The Hunger Games</i>--it will probably be awhile before one fully emerges and I can begin to develop it. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> The Hunger Games is an annual televised event in which one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts is forced to participate in a fight-to-the-death on live TV. What do you think the appeal of reality television is--to both kids and adults? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Well, they're often set up as games and, like sporting events, there's an interest in seeing who wins. The contestants are usually unknown, which makes them relatable. Sometimes they have very talented people performing. Then there's the voyeuristic thrill&#x2014;watching people being humiliated, or brought to tears, or suffering physically--which I find very disturbing. There's also the potential for desensitizing the audience, so that when they see real tragedy playing out on, say, the news, it doesn't have the impact it should.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> If you were forced to compete in the Hunger Games, what do you think your special skill would be? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Hiding. I'd be scaling those trees like Katniss and Rue. Since I was trained in sword-fighting, I guess my best hope would be to get hold of a rapier if there was one available. But the truth is I'd probably get about a four in Training.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What do you hope readers will come away with when they read The Hunger Games trilogy?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Questions about how elements of the books might be relevant in their own lives. And, if they're disturbing, what they might do about them. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> What were some of your favorite novels when you were a teen?<p></p> <b>A:</b> <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i> by Betty Smith <br> <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i> by Carson McCullers <br> <i>Nineteen Eighty Four</i> by George Orwell <br> <i>Anna Karenina</i> by Leo Tolstoy <br> <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut <br> <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> by Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle <br> <i>Lord of the Flies</i> by William Golding <br> <i>Boris</i> by Jaapter Haar <br> <i>Germinal</i> by Emile Zola <br> <i>Dandelion Wine</i> by Ray Bradbury <br> <p>(Photo � Cap Pryor)</p> <br> <br>Suzanne Collins is the author of the groundbreaking Hunger Games trilogy for young adults: <i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>Catching Fire</i>, and <i>Mockingjay</i>.

His work reveals how much China depends on the existing order and how the interests of the Chinese elites maintain these ties. Through its perpetuation of the dollar standard and its addiction to U.S. Treasury bonds, China remains bound to the terms of its own prosperity, and its economic practices of exploiting debt bubbles are destined to fail.

Wesley explores a unique holiday in Texas that has recently begun to be celebrated by African Americans in other parts of the U.S. as well. While Lincoln declared the slaves free in January 1863, the slaves in Texas were not freed until June 19, 1865. Set in 1943, this story tells of June, a young African-American Texan, and her cousin who is visiting from New York City. Juneteenth is June's favorite holiday, but Lillie belittles it until the girls go to the big celebratory picnic and their great-great-aunt Marshall, once a slave, helps her understand the importance of "freedom's gifts." Besides providing good basic information on the holiday, the author sketches nicely the loving relationship between Aunt Marshall and June, and the wary, hostile atmosphere between the cousins, which gradually changes. By setting the story in 1943, Wesley underlines Aunt Marshall's contention that even though their people still must use segregated facilities, "freedom's gifts" are precious and will grow with time. The impressionistic pastel illustrations are lovely, rendered in warm colors that convey the heat of the summer and the joyousness of the town's celebration. A beautiful effort, of special interest to Texans, but sure to enrich any library collection because of its subject matter and its quality.?Judith Constantinides, East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3^-6. On June_ 19, 1943, June's family is celebrating the annual Juneteenth holiday, commemorating the day in 1865 when the slaves in Texas were first told they were free. June's sullen cousin Lillie, visiting from New York City, is bored with "the dumb old slave holiday," but when their Great-great-aunt Marshall tells them about what it was like for her to be born a slave and to be set free, even Lillie is profoundly moved. The cousins become friends, and Juneteenth is their holiday, too. Yet, it is 1943, there are "Whites Only" signs in the town, and Lillie shows June that there is still freedom to be fought for. The layered narrative is sometimes confusing, set in the past and talking about the past, but if middle-graders read the historical note at the back, they will be ready for the family story. Wilson's handsome full-page pastels--like her illustrations for Sisulu's <i>The Day Gogo Went to Vote</i> (1996)--capture the family scenes, with realistic portraits of old and young celebrating their hard-won freedom. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>A Parchment of Leaves</h2><p>When Silas House made his debut with Clay's Quilt last year, it touched a nerve not just in his home state (where it quickly became a bestseller), but all across the country.

House knows what's important and reminds us of the value of family and home, love and loyalty), to the Mobile Register (Poetic, haunting), and everywhere in between-established him as a writer to watch.<p> His second novel won't disappoint. Set in 1917, A PARCHMENT OF LEAVES tells the story of Vine, a beautiful Cherokee woman who marries a white man, forsaking her family and their homeland to settle in with his people and make a home in the heart of the mountains. Her mother has strange forebodings that all will not go well, and she's right. Vine is viewed as an outsider, treated with contempt by other townspeople. Add to that her brother-in-law's fixation on her, and Vine's life becomes more complicated than she could have ever imagined. In the violent turn of events that ensues, she learns what it means to forgive others and, most important, how to forgive herself.</p><p> As haunting as an old-time ballad, A PARCHMENT OF LEAVES is filled with the imagery, dialect, music, and thrumming life of the Kentucky mountains. For Silas House, whose great-grandmother was Cherokee, this novel is also a tribute to the family whose spirit formed him. </p><p></p><p></p></p><p>&#x201c;A beautiful, heartbreaking novel, so vividly imagined and told that it stays with you, powerfully, long after you&#x2019;ve read it. . . .

He is wary but unafraid of the Cherokee girl there whose beauty is said to cause the death of all men who see her. But the minute Saul lays eyes on Vine, he knows she is meant to be his wife. Vine&#x2019;s mother disapproves of the mixed marriage; Saul&#x2019;s mother, Esme, has always been ill at ease around the Cherokee people. But once Vine walks into God&#x2019;s Creek, Saul&#x2019;s mother and brother Aaron take to her immediately. It quickly becomes clear to Vine, though, that Aaron is obsessed with her. And when Saul leaves God&#x2019;s Creek for a year to work in another county, the wife he leaves behind will never be the same again. The violence that lies ahead for Vine, will not only test her spirit, but also her ability to forgive&#x2014;both others and herself. . . .</p><h2>Robert&#39;s Rules of Order Newly Revised</h2><p><b>The only authorized edition of the classic work on parliamentary procedure, with new and enhanced features, including how to conduct electronic meetings</b><b><i><br></i></b><b><i>Robert's Rules of Order</i></b> is <i>the</i> book on parliamentary procedure for parliamentarians and anyone involved in an organization, association, club, or group and the authoritative guide to smooth, orderly, and fairly conducted meetings and assemblies.

One of the most elegant and visually stunning dishes to serve is the little known and often misunderstood French creation: the terrine. A terrine takes its name from the glazed, rectangular, earthenware baking dish in which it is cooked. Terrines can be prepared in a variety of surprising ways, layered with an unlimited array of savory or sweet ingredients, and served hot, warm or cold as an appetizer, main course or dessert. <br><br>No one knows more about terrines than French chef and restaurateur St�phane Reynaud, the author of one of 2007 s most talked about cookbooks, <i>Pork &amp; Sons</i>. In this sequel, he brings together his passion for regional French cooking and his enthusiasm for creating modern takes on culinary classics. <b>TERRINE</b> is a gorgeous collection of over 100 rustic recipes of vegetable, meat, fish, cheese and dessert terrines (including variations of rilletes, p�t�s and parfaits) that can be easily prepared and shared with appreciative friends and family. <br><br>St�phane Reynaud hails from a family of butchers in the Ard�che region of France, and his recipes reflect a rustic purity and simplicity all too rare in the food world. In <b>TERRINE</b>, he describes why he wanted to write a cookbook dedicated to the subject, ''Classic meat, poultry and game terrines can be rustic or sophisticated, luxurious or thrifty. In my native Ard�che, where the back of my family s butcher shop was my playroom, I was brought up eating homemade terrine everyday. My grandparents kitchen reflected their working life, and meat terrines of all types were always on the menu.'' Reynaud felt that he was uniquely qualified to write a cookbook that would teach today's home cooks how to master this ancient French cooking technique.<br><br><b>TERRINE</b> features an assortment of mouthwatering recipes that take the classic dish to uncharted territory, including Gorgonzola, Mascarpone and Nut Terrine; Terrine of Baby Leeks; Crab and Smoked Salmon Terrine; Oxtail and Red Wine Terrine; Foie Gras and Artichoke Terrine; Wild Boar Terrine with Blackcurrants; Rabbit Rillettes; Milk Chocolate Cr�pe Terrine; Chestnut, Meringue and Chantilly Terrine; Strawberry and Fresh Mint Terrine; Coffee Terrine and many other delectable creations. Also provided are recipes for a variety of sauces and garnishes such as Chive and Shallot Cream, Pickled Vegetables and homemade Mango Chutney to accompany the main dishes. A handy glossary of terms is included in the back of the book.<br><br>The majority of the recipes in the book call for a classic terrine mold which can be purchased at all major retailers, from brands such as Le Creuset and Emile Henry. You can also use a souffl� dish, loaf pan, sterilized preserving jar or individual ramekins, but a lid is often required. The standard preparation is to layer ingredients in a terrine mold, place it into a roasting pan, pour boiling water so it reaches halfway up the side of the dish and then place it in to the oven to bake. Dessert terrines are often not cooked and are instead chilled in the refrigerator until set. <br><br>This accessible cookbook is perfect for both culinary novices and seasoned professionals as each recipe is illustrated with a gorgeous full-page color photograph. From the simple and classic to the modern and experimental, <b>TERRINE</b> offers over one hundred ways to bring an age-old French culinary tradition to your home kitchen.</p><p>St�phane Reynaud is co-owner of the restaurant <i>Villa 9 Trois</i> in Montreuil, just outside of Paris. He published his first cookbook, <i>Pork &amp; Sons</i>, also by Phaidon Press, to great acclaim in 2007. It was nominated for a Quills Award and made many ''best cookbook of the year'' lists. Reynaud has appeared on national TV shows such as ''The Martha Stewart Show'' and on radio shows such as NPR s ''The Splendid Table.'' He lives in Paris and Saint-Agr�ve, a small village in Ard�che region of France, with his wife and three children. <i>Terrine</i> is his second cookbook.Starred Review. Though the term technically refers to a glazed earthenware baking dish, most gourmands associate "terrine" with the rich, multilayered bake (typically featuring game, venison or other meats) made in it, the best known of which is pat�. While French restaurateur Reynaud (Pork &amp; Sons) includes a number of classic versions, he also includes inspiring riffs that feature vegetables, fish, cheese and even chocolate, fruit and meringue. Opening with a collection of vegetable-based terrines, Reynaud offers a Ratatouille Terrine, an Artichoke and Porcini Terrine (with caramelized porcini and pine nuts) and a luscious terrine of baby leeks before moving on to fish (red mullet with morels and fava beans, smoked halibut with horseradish and langoustine), with a handful of accompanying sauces. Meat-based terrines range from traditional chicken liver (supplemented with ground pork belly and brandy) to Pig's Head Pat� to Veal Sweetbread and Smoked Ham Terrine.

If those fish had sought to improve their aquatic Science, devised new fills and new philosophies, they would have been completely beside the point. Now the question is whether we will find the WAY, not to improve the human suffocation, but to be and live otherwise on this earth. Is there within this human body a handle, a lever, that would enable us to change our way of being on earth, just as the first mental vibration some three million years ago paved the way for Einstein and the Boeing 747? What vibration? Where, in the body? Could it be that the primary form of living matter, the cell, holds a power of consciousness or a &#34;vibratory mode&#34; capable of making all our present mental devices and pointless artifices obsolete? In other words, a Mind of the Cells which will open up to us new sources of energy, new methods of communication, a new power to handle matter. A new biology and a new consciousness which will enable us to face the challenge of a species on its way to self-destruction. Such is the incredible discovery of Sri Aurobindo and Mother in the cells of the body, at a time when the earth is suffocating. For &#34;Salvation is physical,&#34; said Mother, who, at the age of eighty, dared to knock at the last door in the body, and who made the most extraordinary discovery since Darwin.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Haunt Couture and Ghosts Galore (A Haunted Vintage Mystery)</h2><p><b>This looks like a job for the fashion police!</b><br><br>A hot-ticket charity fashion show is the perfect chance for Cookie Chanel, proud owner of It's Vintage Y'All, to show off her stylistic savvy for a good cause.

For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the <i>Books of Blood</i> is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes: <p> </p> I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. <p> Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago. </p> <p> These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: "The Midnight Meat Train," a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; "The Yattering and Jack," about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; "In the Hills, the Cities," an unusual example of an original horror premise; "Dread," a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; "Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament," about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Clive Barker was born in Liverpool in 1952.

His son Grant, a shiftless dandy with a resemblance to Edgar Allan Poe, is conducting an affair with his voluptuous and volatile cousin. And behind everyone's back, Grandmother Pearl has just signed the family property over to the Almighty.<br><br>In the literature of the American prairie, few families are as brawling, as benighted, or as outrageously vital as the Fargos of Verdon, Nebraska. And when Jim Thompson chronicles their life and times, the result suggest Willa Cather steeped in rotguut--and armed with a .45.</p><p>(1906 - 1977) James Meyers Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).Noir writer Thompson, who has been getting a lot of attention lately in paperback reissue and in movie versions of some of his downbeat studies of small, thwarted lives, began rather differently, as evidenced in this reprinting of his second novel, first published in 1946. While scarcely the " lost classic" its publisher claims, it is an interesting period piece, an odd mix of social realism and early Dallas. Set in a small Nebraska town around 1914, it tells of the interlocking lives of the mean-spirited, brawling Fargo clan, a charming young lawyer who becomes a crooked politico, an embittered English bank clerk dying slowly of syphilis, sundry vivacious kids, and the glamorous Bella, whose longing to get away to the big city ends in death. Winding up in a Grand Guignol finish, this is very much a young man's book, full of uninhibited energy, mixing scenes that work with ones that emphatically don't, and demonstrating flashes of insight alongside crude tomfoolery. And there are embarrassing bursts of mawkish "fine writing," of cut-rate Thomas Wolfe. But there is also a real feel for small-town life, a clearheaded, populist view of American economic imperatives, and an endearing playfulness that does not survive in the somber later Thompson. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mummies &amp; Magic: The Funerary Arts of Ancient Egypt</h2><p>Frontis. + 272 pp., profusely illus., 4to.</p><p></p><h2>Robert B.

Although some might say he&#x2019;s a smart-ass.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like him already.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does any of this make sense to you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did your lawyer say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then?&#x201d; Sheila said. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t have a lawyer. I couldn&#x2019;t make the hearing. I had to work or I&#x2019;d get fired, so Dillon&#x2019;s grandfather took him. It&#x2019;s my mistake. I would have never signed that stupid piece of paper. It waived his right to an attorney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bet your ass,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Rita&#x2019;s now got a young attorney at her firm to help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he make threatening remarks on Twitter?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was all a big joke. He may have wrote something about the guy getting his privates stuck in an appliance. He did say the guy liked to garden in the nude.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In all fairness,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;pruning shears could be dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You get it,&#x201d; Sheila said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gag.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing this for a long time,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And in those years it never ceases to amaze me the great wealth of people born without a sense of humor.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheila took in a large breath, threw her hands up in the air, jewelry clanging, and said, &#x201c;Oh, thank God,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll help me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What can I do?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Sounds like Rita&#x2019;s firm is on it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They are,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But while they&#x2019;re filing papers and stuff, I want to know how this crap happened. Rita says it&#x2019;s one of the craziest things she&#x2019;s ever heard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where was he charged?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Blackburn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The Riviera of the North.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t my choice to live there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I grew up in Newton. I took a job there after I split with Dillon&#x2019;s dad. You do what you can.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. I reached over the sandwich for a yellow legal pad and wrote her name at the top left corner. I asked her for a phone number and an address. I asked her son&#x2019;s full legal name and his date of birth. She told me more about the charges and then a lot about the judge.</p><p>&#x201c;Judge Scali,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a class-A prick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s a campaign slogan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the Zero Tolerance for Minors guy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know who I&#x2019;m talking about now? He&#x2019;s all over the news and on the radio. He says what he does is tough love. Says parents that complain can deal with him now or go see their kids at Walpole later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never heard of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s a big freakin&#x2019; deal in Blackburn,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everyone up there is afraid of him. They think his word is God. The DA, the public defender, the cops. No one will listen to me. That&#x2019;s when I called Rita. I used to work in the business office at Cone, Oakes. I don&#x2019;t have a law degree, but I know when I&#x2019;m being jerked around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Dillon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t let me see him,&#x201d; she said, reaching into her purse for a tissue. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t let me talk to him but once every couple weeks. They say it&#x2019;s part of his rehabilitation out on Fortune Island. Rehabbing what? Being a wise guy? These people up there are nuts.&#x201d; She started to cry but then just as quickly wiped her eyes and sat up.</p><p>I leaned back into my chair. I crossed my arms over my chest. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make any promises,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I can check into things. Maybe find out something to help your attorney for appeals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When can you start?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at the day planner on my desk. I flipped through several empty pages. &#x201c;How about tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus, you mean it?&#x201d; she said, standing, coming around the desk. As I stood, she reached to hug me. I didn&#x2019;t return the embrace, only patted her back a couple times. &#x201c;You know I probably can&#x2019;t afford your day rate, whatever it is. I saw how much some snoops charged the firm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Outrageous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ll help anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. She walked back to the client chair and grabbed her big purse. She did not sit. I looked down at my desk and saw my sandwich waiting, only one bite mark in place. The coffee had probably grown cold.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been able to sleep or eat since this happened. I blame my dad. I blame myself. The only person I don&#x2019;t blame is Dillon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t sound like it&#x2019;s his fault.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good kid,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t deserve to be treated like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone in Blackburn says I&#x2019;m an outsider,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They tell me to let this all play out. Keep my mouth shut. Don&#x2019;t piss people off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me piss &#x2019;em off,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you&#x2019;re good at that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had years of practice.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Blackburn, Massachusetts, didn&#x2019;t appear on many tourist maps of New England. The old mill town, about thirty miles north of Boston on I-93, had lost any of its Norman Rockwell charm long ago. The huge brick mills stood like forgotten fortresses along the slow-moving black water of the Merrimack. The skies were gray. A light snow was falling. As I crossed over a rusting metal bridge, I saw ice chunks in the river. I made a mental note: only sixty-nine days until opening day.</p><p>I drove around a bit, cruising the downtown and Central Avenue toward the Victorian-era city hall. Most of the storefronts sat empty. I passed the police station, an all-night diner called The Owl, a Vietnamese grocery, and several corner bars. There was the high end of town with an upstart coffee shop and a ladies&#x2019; boutique. There was a low end of town with Farman&#x2019;s Salvage and a scratch-and-dent furniture warehouse. I soon ended up in front of Blackburn High School and parked in a space reserved for the school resource officer.</p><p>Might as well start making friends now.</p><p>Blackburn High looked to have been built in the twenties, constructed of blondish brick and dull glass blocks. According to a sign, it was home to the Fighting Eagles. I checked in at the office, as thuggish middle-aged men were often frowned upon for wandering school corridors. And these days, schools were locked down after the first bell.</p><p>A dour-looking woman in an oversized T-shirt reading ACHIEVE! issued me a badge, unlocked the entrance, and gave me directions to where I was headed.</p><p>The school had that familiar scent of old books and disinfectants. Being in school always tightened my stomach. My best day in high school had been graduation.</p><p>I found Officer Lorenzo sitting at his desk, hunched over a computer and not looking up even after I knocked on his open door. He was a fat guy with a couple chins in need of a shave. He wore a baseball hat, too small for his big head, with an embroidered law enforcement star reading BLACKBURN POLICE DEPARTMENT. I waited in the doorway until he could summon the energy to look up at me. To call his appearance slothlike was a true insult to the animal kingdom.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill out the form,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You can drop it at the front desk.&#x201d;</p><p>He had yet to look up.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t speak. Finally he lifted his eyes, refocusing.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here for the form.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you a sub?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do I look like a sub?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look like me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A guy who loads trucks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not here to award you officer of the year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha, ha,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Then what the hell do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>I took a seat without being asked. His minuscule office was very sloppy, filled with stacks of newspapers, old copies of <i>Guns &amp; Ammo</i>, and a shelf full of playbook binders. He&#x2019;d fitted cardboard in the windows to keep out any light.

The powerful, voracious Rodrigo Borgia, better known to history as Pope Alexander VI, was the central figure of the dynasty. Two of his seven papal offspring also rose to power and fame&#x2014;Lucrezia Borgia, his daughter, whose husband was famously murdered by her brother, and that brother, Cesare, who served as the model for Niccol� Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i>. Notorious for seizing power, wealth, land, and titles through bribery, marriage, and murder, the dynasty's dramatic rise from its Spanish roots to its occupation of the highest position in Renaissance society forms a gripping tale. <br><br>Erudite, witty, and always insightful, Hibbert removes the layers of myth around the Borgia family and creates a portrait alive with his superb sense of character and place.</p></p><p>Christopher Hibbert has written more than fifty acclaimed books, including <i>The Rise and Fall of the House of Medici</i> and <i>Rome: The Biography of a City</i>. A leading popular historian whose works reflect meticulous scholarship, he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He is married with three children&nbsp;and lives in Oxfordshire. <p></p><i>&#x2014; Chapter 1 &#x2014; <p></p></i>The Crumbling City <p></p>"Oh God, how pitiable is Rome" <p></p><p></p>"YOU MUST HAVE heard of this city from others," wrote a visitor to Rome in the middle of the fifteenth century. <p></p><p></p>There are many splendid palaces, houses, tombs and temples here, and infinite numbers of other edifices, but they are all in ruins. There is much porphyry and marble from ancient buildings but every day these marbles are destroyed in a scandalous fashion by being burned to make lime. And what is modern is poor stuff. . . . The men of today, who call themselves Romans, are very different in bearing and conduct from the ancient inhabitants. . . . They all look like cowherds. <p></p><p></p>Other visitors wrote of moss-covered statues, of defaced and indecipherable inscriptions, of "parts within the walls that look like thick woods or caves where forest animals were wont to breed, of deer and hares being caught in the streets . . . of the daily sight of heads and limbs of men who had been executed and quartered being nailed to doors, placed in cages or impaled on spears." <p></p>This was the state of the city that had once been the capital of a mighty empire; now two-thirds of the area inside the walls, which had been built to protect a population of 800,000, was uninhabited, acres of open countryside used for orchards, pasture, and vineyards, and dotted with ancient ruins, which provided safe hiding places for thieves and bandits. And this was the state of the true home of the pope, the leader of the church who could trace his predecessors back in an unbroken line to St. Peter, the apostle entrusted by Christ himself with the care of his flock. <p></p>For most of the fourteenth century, even the papacy had abandoned Rome. In 1305, distressed by the unrest and bloody disturbances in the city, the French Pope Clement V (1305&#x2013;14) had set up his court in Avignon, in the rambling palace on the east bank of the Rh�ne, which is known as the Palais des Papes. In Rome there had been constant calls for the papacy to return from its French exile. Most recently these calls had come from an elderly woman, who could be seen almost every day in the crumbling city, sitting by the door of the convent of San Lorenzo, begging for alms for the poor. <p></p>She was Birgitta Gudmarsson, the daughter of a rich Swedish judge and widow of a Swedish nobleman, to whom she had been married at the age of thirteen and for whom she had borne eight children. Founder of the Brigittines, she had left Sweden after experiencing a vision in which Christ had appeared before her, commanding her to leave immediately for Rome and to remain there until she had witnessed the pope&#x2019;s return. As she went about Rome, from church to crumbling church, house to ruinous house, she claimed to have had further visions; both Jesus and his mother Mary, she said, had spoken to her, and they had strengthened her faith in the restoration of the pope and in the eventual salvation of the city. <p></p>Around the house where she lived stretched the charred shells of burned-out buildings, piles of rotting refuse, deserted palaces, derelict churches, stagnant swamps, fortresses abandoned by their rich owners, who had gone to live on their estates in the Campagna, hovels occupied by families on the verge of starvation. Pilgrims took home with them stories of a gloomy city, whose silence was broken only by the howling of dogs and wolves, and the shouts of rampaging mobs. <p></p>In Avignon the popes remained deaf to the calls for their return, heedless of the prayers that the saintly Birgitta Gudmarsson uttered so fervently and of the letters that the poet Francesco Petrarch wrote, describing the "rubbish heap of history" that Rome had become. This once-superb imperial capital was now a lawless ruin, a city torn by violence in which belligerent factions paraded through the streets with daggers and swords, where houses were invaded and looted by armed bands, pilgrims and travellers were robbed, nuns violated in their convents, and long lines of flagellants filed through the gates, barefoot, their heads covered in cowls, claiming board and lodging but offering no money, scourging their naked bloody backs, chanting frightening hymns outside churches, throwing themselves weeping, moaning, bleeding before the altars. <p></p><p></p><p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Christopher Hibbert and Mary Hollingsworth <p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

Sullivan, S.J. taught ecclesiology at the Gregorian University in Rome for 35 years until 1993. Since then he has taught in the Theology Department at Boston College. His other books include &#39;Creative Fidelity&#39;, &#39;Charisms and Charismatic Renewal&#39;, &#39;The Church We Believe In&#39; (Paulist Press), and &#39;From Apostles to Bishops&#39; (Paulist Press).Sullivan traces the history of the teaching that "outside the Church there is no salvation" from Justin Martyr (second century) to the present. Sullivan is sensitive not only to the verbal formula but to its interpretation. The shift from a narrow and pessimistic view of the possibility of salvation, a view limiting salvation to some in communion with the church, to an open and optimistic view which stresses God's universal redemptive will has important ramifications for ecumenical Christian and interfaith dialog, as well as for Christology itself. Sullivan makes these issues clear.

The next afternoon, the naked bodies of Stevie Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore were found submerged in a nearby stream. The boys had been bound from ankle to wrist with their own shoelaces and severely beaten. Christopher had been castrated. The crime scene had yielded few clues, and despite Christopher&#39;s castration, there was a remarkable absence of blood. The police were stymied, and citizens&#39; alarm mounted as weeks passed without an arrest. Finally, a month after the murders, detectives announced three arrests -- and a startling theory of the crime: that the children had been killed by members of a satanic cult. Detectives attributed their break in the case to a former special education student, seventeen-year-old Jessie Misskelley Jr. Although Jessie insisted he knew nothing of the crime, after eight hours of questioning, police announced that he had implicated himself and accused two other teenagers, eighteen-year-old Damien Echols and sixteen-year-old Jason Baldwin. Damien and Jason both denied Jessie&#39;s account, and Jessie himself recanted it within hours, but by then all three had been charged with the murders. With no physical evidence connecting anyone to the crime, prosecutors contended that the murders bore signs of &#34;the occult&#34; and that the three accused teenagers possessed a &#34;state of mind&#34; that pointed to them as the killers. As proof of the defendants&#39; mental states, they introduced items taken from their rooms -- such as books by Anne Rice and album posters for the rock group Metallica. Jurors found all three teenagers guilty. Jessie and Jason were sentenced to life in prison. Damien was sentenced to death. While the verdicts were popular in Arkansas, an HBO documentary raised questions about the lack of evidence in the case, and a Web site was formed to support the inmates, now known as &#34;The West Memphis Three.&#34; When the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the verdicts, state officials insisted that anyone who questioned the trials simply did not know &#34;the facts.&#34; Now, for the first time, an award-winning investigative reporter examines that official stand. In riveting narrative, Devil&#39;s Knot draws readers into the drama of a modern-day courtroom dominated by references to Satan. In laying out &#34;the facts&#34; of this still-unfolding case, it offers a frightening look into America&#39;s system of justice.</p><p><b>Mara Leveritt</b> won a White Award for investigative journalism in 1991, was named Arkansas Journalist of the Year in 1992, and was awarded Arkansas's Booker Worthen Prize in 2000 for her book <i>The Boys on the Tracks.</i> A contributing editor to the <i>Arkansas Times,</i> she lives in Little Rock.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> <b>The Murders</b> </p><p> At 7:41 P.M. on May 5, 1993, a full moon rose behind the Memphis skyline. Its light glinted across the Mississippi River and fell onto the midsized Arkansas town aspiringly named West Memphis. Sometime between the rising of that moon and its setting the next morning, something diabolical would happen in West Memphis. Three eight-year-old boys would vanish, plucked off the streets of their neighborhood by an unseen, murderous hand. Under the glare of the next day's sun, police would discover three young bodies. They would be pulled -- naked, pale, bound, and beaten -- from a watery ditch in a patch of woods alongside two of America's busiest highways. But the investigation would unfold in shadow. Why had one of the boys been castrated? How to account for the absence of blood? Why did the banks of the stream look swept clean? The police would stumble for weeks without clues -- until the moon itself became one. </p><p> John Mark Byers, an unemployed jeweler, was the first parent to report a child missing. At 8 P.M., with the full moon on the rise, Byers telephoned the West Memphis police. Ten minutes later, a patrol officer responded. She drove her cruiser down East Barton Street, in a working-class neighborhood. At the corner where Barton intersected Fourteenth Street, the officer stopped in front of the Byerses' three-bedroom house. Byers, an imposing man, six feet five inches tall, weighing more than two hundred pounds, with long hair tied back in a ponytail, met her at the door. Behind him stood his wife, Melissa, five feet six, somewhat heavyset, with long hair and hollow eyes. Mark Byers did most of the talking. The officer listened and took notes. "The last time the victim was seen, he was cleaning the yard at 5:30 P.M." That would have been an hour and twenty minutes before sunset. The Byerses described Christopher as four feet four inches tall, weighing fifty pounds, with hair and eyes that were both light brown. He was eight years old. </p><p> The officer left the Byerses' house, and within minutes was dispatched to another call, at a chicken restaurant about a mile away. She pulled up at the Bojangles drive-through at 8:42 P.M. Through the window, the manager reported that a bleeding black man had entered the restaurant about a half hour before and gone into the women's rest room. The manager told the officer that the man, who had blood on his face and who had seemed "mentally disoriented," had wandered away from the premises just a few minutes before she arrived. When employees entered the rest room after he left, they found blood smeared on the walls. The officer took the report but investigated the incident no further. At 9:01, without ever having entered the restaurant, she drove away to a criminal mischief complaint about someone throwing eggs at a house. </p><p> At 9:24 P.M., the same officer responded to another call, again from Barton Street -- this one from the house directly across from the Byerses'. Here a woman, Dana Moore, reported that her eight-year-old son, Michael, was also missing. Taking out her pad again, the officer wrote, "Complainant stated she observed the victim (her son) riding bicycles with his friends Stevie Branch and Christopher Byers. When she lost sight of the boys, she sent her daughter to find them. The boys could not be found." Moore said the boys had been riding on North Fourteenth Street, going toward Goodwin. That had been almost three and a half hours earlier, at about 6 P.M. By now, it had been dark for more than two hours. "Michael is described as four feet tall, sixty pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes," the officer wrote. "He was last seen wearing blue pants, blue Boy Scouts of America shirt, orange and blue Boy Scout hat and tennis shoes." </p><p> By now a second officer had been dispatched to a catfish restaurant several blocks away. There another mother, Pamela Hobbs, was reporting that her eight-year-old son, Stevie Edward Branch, was missing as well. Hobbs lived at Sixteenth Street and McAuley Drive, a few blocks away from the Byerses and the Moores. She reported that her son, Stevie, had left home after school and that no one had seen him since. The officer who took Hobbs's report did not note who was supposed to have been watching Stevie while his mother was at work, or who had notified Hobbs that her son was missing. Stevie was described as four feet two inches tall, sixty pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. The police report noted, "He was last seen wearing blue jeans and white T-shirt. He was riding a twenty-inch Renegade bicycle." </p><p> Word of the disappearances spread quickly through the subdivision. As groups of parents began searching, other residents reported that they had seen some boys -- three, or maybe four -- riding bikes near the dead end of McAuley Drive shortly before sunset. McAuley was a major street in the neighborhood. The house on McAuley where Stevie Branch lived was a few blocks south of the corner on Barton where the other two missing boys lived across the street from each other. From Stevie's house, McAuley wound west for a few blocks, ending at the edge of a four-acre patch of woods, a short distance northwest of the other boys' homes. The woods separated the subdivision from two interstate highways and their service roads on the north. The small sylvan space provided the neighborhood with a welcome buffer from the traffic on their northern edge. For a few diesel-fumed miles, east-west Interstate 40, spanning the United States between North Carolina and California, converges in West Memphis, Arkansas, with north-south I-55, connecting New Orleans to Chicago. For truckers and other travelers, the stretch is a major midcontinental rest stop; where the highways hum through West Memphis, the city has formed a corridor of fueling stations, motels, and restaurants. It was easy for anyone passing through not to notice the small patch of woods bordering that short section of highway. What was more noticeable was the big blue-and-yellow sign for the Blue Beacon Truck Wash that stood several yards from the edge of the woods, alongside the service road. </p><p> Just as truckers knew the Blue Beacon, kids in the neighborhood to the south were familiar with the woods. The small plot of trees represented park, playground, and wilderness for children and teenagers living in the subdivision's modest three-bedroom houses and in the still more modest apartment building nearby. That the woods existed at all was an acknowledgment, not of the need for parks or of places for children to play, but of the need for flood control. Years earlier the city had dredged a channel, unromantically known as the Ten Mile Bayou Diversion Ditch, to dispose of rainwater that ordinarily would have flowed into the Mississippi River but that was prevented from draining by the great levees that held back the river. While the levees kept the Mississippi at bay, rainwater trapped on the city side of the levee had posed a different flood problem for years. The Ten Mile Bayou Diversion Ditch was dredged to direct rainwater around the city to a point far to the south, where a break in the Mississippi levee finally allowed it to drain. Part of that ditch ran through this stand of trees. In places, the ditch was forty feet wide and could fill three or four feet deep. Tributaries, such as the one that drained the land directly behind the Blue Beacon, formed deep gullies in the alluvial soil. Together, the combination of trees, ravines, water, and vines made the area a hilly wonderland for kids with few unpaved places to play. </p><p> They called the woods Robin Hood. Adults tended to make the name sound more proper, calling it Robin Hood Hills, but it was always just Robin Hood for the kids. Under its green canopy they etched out bike trails, built dirt ramps, established forts, and tied up ropes for swinging over the man-made "river." They fished, scouted, camped, hunted, had wars, and let their imaginations run. But at night, when the woods turned dark, most kids stayed away. The place didn't seem so friendly then, and the things that parents could imagine translated into stern commands. </p><p> Besides the risks from water and Robin Hood's closeness to the highways, parents worried about transients who might be lurking there. Many parents warned their children to stay out of the woods entirely. But the ban was impossible to enforce. Robin Hood was too alluring. And so it was inevitable, on that Wednesday night in May, as word flew from house to house that three eight-year-olds were missing, that parents would rush to the dead end of McAuley, where a path led into the woods. It was about a half mile from the homes of Christopher Byers and Michael Moore and only a few blocks farther from that of Stevie Branch. </p><p> The delta was already beginning to warm up for the summer. At 9 P.M., even on May 5, the temperature was seventy-three degrees. An inch of rain a few days before had already brought out the mosquitoes. The insects were a nuisance everywhere, but they were especially thick in places that were moist and overgrown -- shady places like the woods. The officer who'd taken the missing-person reports on Christopher Byers and Michael Moore later reported that she'd ventured into the woods near the Mayfair Apartments to help look for the boys, but the mosquitoes had driven her out. The officer who'd taken the report on Stevie Branch also said later that he'd entered the woods and searched with a flashlight for half an hour. But those two efforts were the only police action that night. No organized search by police would begin until the morning. </p><p> As officers assembled at the West Memphis Police Department for their usual briefing on Thursday morning, May 6, 1993, Chief Inspector Gary W. Gitchell, head of the department's detective division, announced that three boys were missing and that he would be directing the search. A search-and-rescue team from the Crittenden County Sheriff's Office would be assisting. When a few hours had passed without sign of the boys, the police department across the river in Memphis, Tennessee, dispatched a helicopter to assist. By midmorning, dozens of men and women had also joined police in the search. Detectives and ordinary citizens checked yards, parking lots, and various neighborhood buildings, including some still damaged from a tornado that had struck the town the year before. Others fanned out across the two miles of fertile, low-lying farmland that separates the east edge of West Memphis from the levee and the Mississippi River. The most intensive search, however, remained focused on the woods. For hours, groups of as many as fifty law enforcement officers and volunteers combed the rough four acres that lined the diversion ditch. At one point the searchers gathered on the north edge of the woods, near the interstates, and marched shoulder-to-shoulder across the woods until they emerged on the other side, near the houses to the south. But even that effort turned up nothing. Members of the county search-and-rescue team slipped a johnboat into the bayou and poled it down the stream. But still, nothing. By noon, most of the searchers, their alarm increasing, had abandoned the woods to search elsewhere.<br> </p><p> <b>The Bodies</b> </p><p> But one searcher stayed. Steve Jones, a Crittenden County juvenile officer, was tromping through the now empty section of the woods nearest to the Blue Beacon Truck Wash when he looked down into a steep-sided gully, a tributary to the primary ditch, and spotted something on the water. Jones radioed what he had found. Entering the woods from the subdivision side, Sergeant Mike Allen of the West Memphis Police Department rushed across a wide drainpipe that spanned a part of the ditch, and clambered to where Jones was waiting. Jones led Allen to a spot about sixty yards south of the interstates. Standing on the edge of a high-sided bank, Jones pointed down at the water. Floating on the surface was a boy's laceless black tennis shoe. </p><p> The time was approximately 1:30 P.M. The area had been searched for hours. Yet here, alarmingly, was a child's shoe. Police converged on the spot. Sergeant Allen, wearing dress shoes, slacks, a white shirt and tie, was the first to enter the water. It was murky, with shoe-grabbing mud on the bottom. Allen raised a foot. Bubbles gathered around it and floated to the surface. The muck beneath his shoe made a sucking, reluctant sound. Then a pale form began to rise in the water. Slowly, before the horrified officers' eyes, a child's naked body, arched grotesquely backward, rose to the surface. It was about 1:45 P.M. </p><p> Word of the discovery spread like fire through West Memphis. Searchers swarmed back to the woods, but now only Gitchell's detectives were being let in. By 2:15 P.M., yellow crime tape was up. Police cars were stationed at the McAuley Drive entrance to the woods and at the entrance south of the Blue Beacon. For the detectives, in a dense and seldom visited part of the woods kids called Old Robin Hood, the job ahead was as odious as obvious. If one body had been submerged in the stream, the others might be as well. Detective Bryn Ridge volunteered for the unnerving job. Leaving the first body where it floated, the dark-haired, heavyset officer walked several feet downstream and waded into the water. Lowering himself to his knees, he spread his hands on the silty bottom. Then slowly, on all fours, he began to crawl up the narrow stream, searching the mud with his hands, expecting -- and dreading -- that at any moment he would touch another dead child. He encountered instead a stick stuck unnaturally into the mud. He could feel something wrapped around it. Dislodging the stick and pulling it up, he found a child's white shirt. </p><p> Carefully, Ridge stood up and returned to the floating body. It didn't seem right to him to leave it there. He lifted the body to the bank. The officers knew from photographs they'd been shown of the missing boys that this was the body of Michael Moore. And they could see that between the time the boy was last seen and now, he had endured tremendous violence. Michael's hands and feet were behind him, bound in what some would describe as a backward, hog-tied fashion. But it wasn't that, exactly. The limbs weren't tied together. Rather, the left ankle was tied to the left wrist; the right ankle and right wrist were tied. The boy had been tied with shoelaces. The bindings left the body in a dramatically vulnerable pose. The boy's nakedness, the unnatural arch of the back, and the vulnerability of his undeveloped sexual organs, both to the front and to the back, suggested something sexual about the crime. The severity of the wounds to his head suggested a component of rage. </p><p> Once begun, the gruesome search intensified. In quick succession the ditch yielded Michael's Cub Scout cap and shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and the grim, forewarning sight of two more pairs of tennis shoes without laces. Reentering the water and resuming his search by hand, Ridge found more sticks stuck like pins into the muddy bottom. Twisted deliberately around them were other items of clothing. Before long, all the clothing listed on the three missing-person reports had been pulled out of the water, with the exception of a sock and two pairs of underpants. The detectives were especia...</p></p><h2>Gravedigger</h2><p>Hardened death-claim investigator Dave Brandstetter searches for Charles Westover, who, although desperate for money, disappeared before collecting an insurance claim on the death of his runaway daughter who may have been murdered by a desert guru</p><p></p><h2>Breakfast at the Wolseley</h2><p>Breakfast is said to be the most important meal of the day and nowhere is that fact more appreciated than at the Wolseley restaurant in London&#39;s Piccadilly.

All were affected by the same global climatic factors that caused massive crop failures, and all experienced brutal famines that decimated local populations. But the effects of drought were magnified in each case because of singularly destructive policies promulgated by different ruling elites. Davis argues that the seeds of underdevelopment in what later became known as the Third World were sown in this era of High Imperialism, as the price for capitalist modernization was paid in the currency of millions of peasants&#x2019; lives.</p><p><b>Mike Davis</b> is the author of several books including <i>Planet of Slums</i>, <i>City of Quartz</i>, <i>Ecology of Fear</i>, <i>Late Victorian Holocausts</i>, and <i>Magical Urbanism</i>. He was recently awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. He lives in Papa&#x2019;aloa, Hawaii.While this book will not have the impact of Davis's City of Quartz--a scathing indictment of L.A.'s environmental ravagement, economic disparity and racial divides--in a perfect world, it would. Its subject is nothing less than the creation of what we now call "The Third World," through a complex series of seemingly disparate natural and market-related events beginning in the 1870s. Davis dives into the data and journalism of the period with a vengeance, showing that the seemingly unprecedented droughts across northern Africa, India and China in the 1870s and 1890s are consistent with what we now know to be El Ni�o's effects, and that it was political and market forces (which are never impersonal, Davis insists), and not a lack of potential stores and transportation, that kept grain from the more than 50 million people who starved to death. Chapters brilliantly reconstruct the political, economic, ecological and racial climate of the time, as well as the horrific deaths by hunger and thirst that besieged the peasantries of the afflicted c0untries. As in City of Quartz, Ecology of Fear and Magical Urbanism, Davis's synthetic powers, rendering mountains of data into an accessible and cogent form, are matched by his acid castigations of the murders and moral failings that have attended the advance of capitalism, and by cogent detours into the work of journalists and theorists who have come before him, decrying injustice and rallying the opposition. (Feb.)Forecast: Although this book's historical subject seems vastly removed from contemporary American life, it may get some media attention for its El Ni�o-based arguments. City of Quartz still guarantees review attention for any Davis project, which may draw history buffs who haven't heard of him. His substantial core readership will seek out the book either way, and the book's synthesis of hardcore data will also hold appeal for poli-sci syllabi and university libraries. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>What to Eat, What to Drink, What to Leave for Poison</h2><p><p>"Camille Dungy has a garden of verses that spring up with the sunshine or hide with you in the dusk.

Visit her online at LucindaRiley.com.The Seven Sisters <br> <br>1<br> <br>I will always remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard that my father had died.<br> <br>I was sitting in the pretty garden of my old school friend&#x2019;s townhouse in London, a copy of The Penelopiad open but unread in my lap, enjoying the June sun while Jenny collected her little boy from kindergarten.<br> <br>I felt calm and I appreciated what a good idea it had been to get away. When my cell phone rang and I glanced at the screen and saw it was Marina, I was studying the burgeoning clematis unfolding its fragile pink buds, giving birth to a riot of color, encouraged by its sunny midwife.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Ma, how are you?&#x201d; I said, hoping she could hear the sun&#x2019;s warmth in my voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, I . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Marina paused, and in that instant I knew something was dreadfully wrong. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, there&#x2019;s no other way to tell you this, but your father had a heart attack here at home yesterday afternoon, and in the early hours of this morning, he . . . passed away.&#x201d;<br> <br>I remained silent as a million different and ridiculous thoughts passed through my mind. The first one being that Marina, for some unknown reason, had decided to play some form of a tasteless joke on me.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the first of the sisters I&#x2019;ve told, Maia, as you&#x2019;re the eldest. And I wanted to ask you whether you would prefer to tell the rest of your sisters yourself, or leave it to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Still no words would form coherently on my lips, as I began to realize that Marina, dear, beloved Marina, the woman who had been the closest thing to a mother I&#x2019;d ever known, would never tell me this if it weren&#x2019;t true. So it had to be. And at that moment, my entire world shifted on its axis.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, please, tell me you&#x2019;re all right. This really is the most dreadful phone call I&#x2019;ve ever had to make, but what else could I do? God only knows how the other girls are going to take it.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was then that I heard the suffering in her voice and understood she&#x2019;d needed to tell me as much for her own sake as mine. So I switched into my normal comfort zone, which was to comfort others.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;ll tell my sisters if you&#x2019;d prefer, Ma, although I&#x2019;m not positive where they all are. Isn&#x2019;t Ally away training for a regatta?&#x201d;<br> <br>And, as we continued to discuss where each of my younger sisters was, as though we needed to get them together for a birthday party rather than to mourn the death of our father, the entire conversation took on a sense of the surreal.<br> <br>&#x201c;When should we plan on having the funeral, do you think? What with Electra being in Los Angeles and Ally somewhere on the high seas, surely we can&#x2019;t think about it until next week at the earliest,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well&#x201d;&#x2014;I heard the hesitation in Marina&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;&#x201c;perhaps the best thing is for you and I to discuss it when you arrive back home. There really is no rush now, Maia, so if you&#x2019;d prefer to continue the last couple of days of your holiday in London, that would be fine. There&#x2019;s nothing more to be done for him here . . .&#x201d; Her voice trailed off miserably.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma, of course I&#x2019;ll be on the next flight that I can get to Geneva! I&#x2019;ll call the airline immediately and let you know what time the flight is. And in the meantime, I&#x2019;ll do my best to get in touch with everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so terribly sorry, ch�rie,&#x201d; Marina sighed. &#x201c;I know how you adored him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, the strange calm that I had felt while we discussed arrangements suddenly deserting me like the stillness before a violent thunderstorm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you later, when I know what time I&#x2019;ll be arriving.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the meantime, please take care of yourself, Maia. You&#x2019;ve had a terrible shock.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pressed the button to end the call and before the storm clouds in my heart opened up and drowned me, I went upstairs to my bedroom to retrieve my flight documents and contact the airline. As I waited in the calling queue, I glanced at the bed where I&#x2019;d woken up that morning to simply another day. And I thanked God that human beings don&#x2019;t have the power to see into the future.<br> <br>The officious woman who eventually answered wasn&#x2019;t helpful and I knew, as she spoke of full flights, financial penalties, and credit card details, that my emotional dam was ready to burst. Finally, once I&#x2019;d been grudgingly granted a seat on the four o&#x2019;clock flight to Geneva, which would mean throwing everything into my luggage immediately and taking a taxi to Heathrow, I sat down on the bed and stared for so long at the sprigged wallpaper that the pattern began to dance in front of my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; I whispered, &#x201c;gone forever. I&#x2019;ll never see him again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Expecting the spoken words to provoke a raging torrent of tears, I was surprised that nothing actually happened. Instead, I sat there numbly, my head still full of practicalities. The thought of telling my sisters&#x2014;all five of them&#x2014;was horrendous and I searched through my emotional filing system for the one I would call first. Inevitably, it was Tiggy, the second youngest of the six of us girls and the sibling to whom I&#x2019;d always felt closest.<br> <br>With trembling fingers, I scrolled down to find her number and dialed it. When her voice mail answered, I didn&#x2019;t know what to say, other than a few garbled words asking her to call me back urgently. She was currently somewhere in the Scottish Highlands working at a center for orphaned and sick wild deer.<br> <br>As for the other sisters . . . I knew their reactions would vary, outwardly at least, from indifference to a dramatic outpouring of emotion.<br> <br>Given that I wasn&#x2019;t currently sure quite which way I would go on the scale of grief when I did speak to any of them, I decided to take the coward&#x2019;s way out and texted them all, asking them to call me as soon as they could. Then I hurriedly packed my luggage and walked down the narrow stairs to the kitchen to write a note for Jenny explaining why I&#x2019;d had to leave in such a hurry.<br> <br>Deciding to take my chances hailing a black cab on the London streets, I left the house, walking briskly around the leafy Chelsea crescent just as any normal person would do on any normal day. I believe I actually said hello to someone walking a dog when I passed him in the street and managed a smile.<br> <br>No one would know what had just happened to me, I thought as I managed to find a taxi on the busy King&#x2019;s Road and climbed inside it, directing the driver to Heathrow.<br> <br>Nobody would know.<br> <br><br> <br>Five hours later, just as the sun was making its leisurely descent over Lake Geneva, I arrived at our private pontoon on the shore, from where I would make the last leg of my journey home.<br> <br>Christian was already waiting for me in our sleek Riva motor launch. And from the look on his face, I could see he&#x2019;d heard the news.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you, Mademoiselle Maia?&#x201d; he asked, sympathy in his blue eyes as he helped me aboard.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m . . . glad I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; I answered neutrally as I walked to the back of the boat and sat down on the cushioned cream leather seat that curved around the stern. Usually, I would sit with Christian in the passenger seat at the front as we sped across the calm waters on the twenty-minute journey home. But today, I felt a need for privacy. As Christian started the powerful engine, the sun glinted off the windows of the fabulous houses that lined Lake Geneva&#x2019;s shores. I&#x2019;d often felt when I made this journey that it was the entrance to an ethereal world disconnected from reality.<br> <br>The world of Pa Salt.<br> <br>I noticed the first vague evidence of tears pricking at my eyes as I thought of my father&#x2019;s pet name, which I&#x2019;d coined when I was young. He&#x2019;d always loved sailing and often when he returned to me at our lakeside home, he had smelled of fresh air and the sea. Somehow, the name had stuck, and as my younger siblings had joined me, they&#x2019;d called him that too.<br> <br>As the launch picked up speed, the warm wind streaming through my hair, I thought of the hundreds of previous journeys I&#x2019;d made to Atlantis, Pa Salt&#x2019;s fairy-tale castle. Inaccessible by land, due to its position on a private promontory with a crescent of mountainous terrain rising up steeply behind it, the only method of reaching it was by boat. The nearest neighbors were miles away along the lake, so Atlantis was our own private kingdom, set apart from the rest of the world. Everything it contained within it was magical . . . as if Pa Salt and we, his daughters, had lived there under an enchantment.<br> <br>Each one of us had been chosen by Pa Salt as a baby, adopted from one of the four corners of the globe, and brought home to live under his protection. And each one of us, as Pa always liked to say, was special, different . . . we were his girls. He&#x2019;d named us all after the Seven Sisters, his favorite star cluster. I was Maia, being the first and eldest.<br> <br>When I was young, he&#x2019;d take me up to his glass-domed observatory perched on top of the house; lift me up with his big, strong hands; and have me look through his telescope at the night sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;There they are,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say as he aligned the lens, &#x201c;look, Maia, and see the beautiful shining star you&#x2019;re named after.&#x201d;<br> <br>And I would see. As he explained the legends that were the source of my own and my sisters&#x2019; names, I&#x2019;d hardly listen but simply enjoy his arms tight around me, fully aware of this rare, special moment when I had him all to myself.<br> <br>Marina, whom I&#x2019;d presumed as I grew up was my mother&#x2014;I&#x2019;d even shortened her name to &#x201c;Ma&#x201d;&#x2014;I&#x2019;d realized eventually was a glorified nursemaid, employed by Pa to take care of me, because he was away so much. But of course, Marina was so much more than that to all of us girls. She was the one who had wiped our tears, berated us for sloppy table manners, and steered us calmly through the difficult transition from childhood to womanhood.<br> <br>She had always been there, and I could not have loved Ma any more if she had given birth to me.<br> <br>During the first three years of my childhood, Marina and I had lived alone together in our magical castle on the shores of Lake Geneva as Pa Salt traveled the seven seas to conduct his business. And then, one by one, my sisters began to arrive.<br> <br>Usually, Pa would bring me a present when he returned home. I&#x2019;d hear the motor launch arriving, run across the sweeping lawns and through the trees to the jetty to greet him. Like any child, I&#x2019;d want to see what he had hidden inside his magical pockets to delight me. On one particular occasion, however, after he&#x2019;d presented me with an exquisitely carved wooden reindeer, which he assured me came from Saint Nicholas&#x2019;s workshop at the North Pole itself, a uniformed woman had stepped out from behind him, and in her arms was a bundle wrapped in a shawl. And the bundle was moving.<br> <br>&#x201c;This time, Maia, I&#x2019;ve brought you back the most special gift. You have a new sister.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d smiled at me as he lifted me into his arms. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ll no longer be lonely when I have to go away.&#x201d;<br> <br>After that, life had changed. The maternity nurse who Pa had brought with him disappeared after a few weeks and Marina took over the care of my baby sister. I couldn&#x2019;t understand how the red, squalling thing which often smelled and diverted attention from me could possibly be a gift. Until one morning, when Alcyone&#x2014;named after the second star of the Seven Sisters&#x2014;smiled at me from her high chair over breakfast.<br> <br>&#x201c;She knows who I am,&#x201d; I said in wonder to Marina, who was feeding her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course she does, Maia dear. You&#x2019;re her big sister, the one she&#x2019;ll look up to. It&#x2019;ll be up to you to teach her lots of things that you know and she doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>And as she grew, she became my shadow, following me everywhere, which pleased and irritated me in equal measure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maia, wait me!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d demand loudly as she tottered along behind me.<br> <br>Even though Ally&#x2014;as I&#x2019;d nicknamed her&#x2014;had originally been an unwanted addition to my dreamlike existence at Atlantis, I could not have asked for a sweeter, more loveable companion. She rarely, if ever, cried and when she was a toddler there were none of the temper tantrums associated with children of her age. With her tumbling red-gold curls and her big blue eyes, Ally had a natural charm that drew people to her, including our father. On the occasions Pa Salt was home from one of his long trips abroad, I&#x2019;d watch how his eyes lit up when he saw her, in a way I was sure they didn&#x2019;t for me. And whereas I was shy and reticent with strangers, Ally had an openness and trust that endeared her to everyone.<br> <br>She was also one of those children who seemed to excel at everything&#x2014;particularly music, and any sport to do with water. I remember Pa teaching her to swim in our vast pool, and whereas I had struggled to master the technique to stay afloat and hated being underwater, my little sister took to it like a mermaid. And while I struggled to find my sea legs even on the Titan, Pa&#x2019;s huge and beautiful oceangoing yacht, when we were at home, Ally would beg him to take her out in the small Laser dinghy he kept moored on our private lakeside jetty. I&#x2019;d crouch in the cramped stern of the boat while Pa and Ally took control as we sped across the glassy waters. Their joint passion for sailing bonded them in a way I felt I could never replicate.<br> <br>Although Ally had studied music at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gen�ve and was a highly talented flautist who could have pursued a career with a professional orchestra, since leaving music school she had chosen the life of a full-time sailor. She now competed regularly in regattas and had represented Switzerland on a number of occasions.<br> <br>When Ally was almost three, Pa arrived home with our next sibling, whom he named Asterope, after the third of the Seven Sisters.<br> <br>&#x201c;But we will call her Star,&#x201d; Pa had said, smiling at Marina, Ally, and me as we studied the newest addition to the family lying in the bassinet.<br> <br>By now I was attending lessons every morning with a private tutor, so my newest sister&#x2019;s arrival affected me less than Ally&#x2019;s had. Then, only six months later, another baby girl joined us, a twelve-week-old named Celaeno, whose name Ally immediately shortened to CeCe.<br> <br>There was only three months&#x2019; age difference between Star and CeCe, and from as far back as I can remember, the two of them forged a close bond. They were like twins, talking in their own private baby language, some of which the two of them still used to communicate. They inhabited their own private world, to the exclusion of us others, and even now, in their twenties, nothing had changed. CeCe, the younger of the two, was always the boss, her stocky body and nut-brown skin in direct contrast to the pale, whippet-thin Star.<br> <br>The following year, another baby arrived, Taygete&#x2014;whom I nicknamed &#x201c;Tiggy&#x201d; because her short, dark hair had sprouted out at strange angles on her tiny head and reminded me of the hedgehog in Beatrix Potter&#x2019;s famous story.<br> <br>I was by now seven years old, and I&#x2019;d bonded with Tiggy from the first moment I set eyes on her. She was the most delicate of us all, suffering one childhood illness after another, but even as an infant, she was stoic and undemanding. When yet another baby girl, named Electra, was brought home by Pa a few months later, an exhausted Marina would often ask me if I would mind sitting with Tiggy, who was continually suffering with a fever or croup. Eventually diagnosed as asthmatic, she rarely left the nursery to be wheeled outside in the pram, in case the cold air and heavy fog of a Geneva ...</p><h2>Godowsky, the Pianists&#39; Pianist. a Biography of Leopold Godowsky.</h2><p>In this book, Jeremy Nicholas reappraises Godowsky&#39;s important contribution to the piano, sheds new light on his enigmatic personality and suggests the soubriquet given him by the critic J.G.

Using the form of interviews with Haring himself as well as with the hustlers and hangers-on, the con men and collectors, the celebrities and sycophants who formed his world, Gruen (Eric Bruhn, 1979, etc.) paints a vivid picture of pop culture in the 1980's. Haring's recounting of his own adventures forms the backbone of the book. He is remarkably frank about his gay life (he died of AIDS at the age of 31), his impatience for fame, his dissatisfaction with the art establishment. Augmenting these revelations are reminiscences by such fellow artists as Kenny Scharf and Roy Lichtenstein, art dealers Leo Castelli and Tony Shafrazi, such cult figures as Madonna and Yoko Ono, as well as Timothy Leary and William Burroughs. Even Princess Caroline of Monaco has a bit to add. It's a glittering roster, and Gruen organizes their diverse points of view with clarity and care. Few dissenting voices are heard, however, and the tone becomes nearly hagiographic. Had Gruen approached some of Haring's detractors--and there are many--the portrait would have been fuller. An occasional note of self-serving creeps in as well, as when Timothy Leary states, ``Keith and I [have] been swept by the waves of the twentieth century into the twenty-first century.'' Still, Leary does have the grace to admit that Haring ``is not Mother Teresa.'' Some readers may also be puzzled by the seeming disparity between Haring's insistence that his work is ``for the people'' and his unremitting name-dropping of the glitterati. Limited, but nonetheless a valuable overview of an 80's phenomenon and his world. (Thirty-two b&amp;w and 105 color photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gruen tells the fascinating story of Haring, from his phenomenal rise on the international art scene as graffiti artist extraordinaire, whose "radiant child" became a worldwide symbol of the Eighties pop culture, to his tragic death from AIDS at the age of 31. The book focuses on Haring's creative talent--including sculpture, painting, murals, and graphic art projects--and on his compulsive work habits, tracing his progress from concept to installation of one-man shows in Australia, Japan, France, and Monaco, among others. His life and work are seen through personal and candid interviews with the artist, members of his family, friends, and celebrities, including William Burroughs, Timothy Leary, Madonna, and Princess Caroline. This shocking, graphic, and entertaining biography, however, depicts life in the fast lane, New York style, with its all-too-familiar components of celebrity, drugs, and sex.

It&#39;s the start of the new school year and the students have arrived at Ratford College. Every year at this time, the whales move off the coast of Whale Island, but this time, a savage killer whale threatens the peace.</p><p><p><b>Thea Stilton</b> was born in New Mouse City, Mouse Island. She is a special correspondent for <i>The Rodent's Gazette</i>, Mouse Island's most famouse newspaper, which is edited by her famouse brother, Geronimo Stilton. A graduate of the prestigious Mouseford Academy, Ms. Stilton is a visiting professor of journalism at Mouseford today. She is also the author of numerous mystery novels based on the exciting lives of her friends and former students, the Thea Sisters. In her spare time, Ms. Stilton loves to travel and go on fabumouse adventures.</p>Colette, Violet, Pamela, Nicky, and Paulina are the Thea Sisters at Mouseford Academy; they study with Thea Stilton, journalist and equally famous sister of the famed Geronimo Stilton. The new school year brings new students, including siblings Vanilla and Vic, children of wealthy businesswoman Vissia De Vissen, who claims to be concerned about the environment. When an orca threatens the local fishermen, however, the Thea Sisters discover that Vissia has plans for the orca and other sea creatures, including the whales of Whale Island, that bode no good for the environment. Thea Stilton is credited as the author, but the story was created by a team of Italian writers and artists and translated by Nanette McGuinness for Papercutz. The story centers on the Thea Sisters rather than on Thea Stilton, who makes only a brief appearance in this book, but most readers won&#x2019;t care. They&#x2019;ll enjoy the action and mystery in this colorful graphic novel. Fans of the chapter books will also enjoy the additional adventures in this new series.

Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their successes over and over?<br><br>People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in com- mon, but they all started with why. Their natural ability to start with why enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.<br><br>In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way-and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.<br><br>Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profit-those are always results. Why does your organization exist? Why does it do the things it does? Why do customers really buy from one company or another? Why are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?<br>Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics.<br><br>Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And people follow them not because they have to; they follow because they want to.<br><br>Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: <br><br>Simon Sinek teaches leaders and companies around the world how to inspire people. From members of Congress to foreign ambassadors, from small businesses to corporations like Microsoft and American Express, from Hollywood to the Pentagon, he has presented his ideas about the power of why. He is quoted frequently by national publications and is a regular contributor to <i>The Huffington Post</i> and <i>BrandWeek.</i> This is his first book.1<br>ASSUME YOU KNOW<br>On a cold January day, a forty-three-year-old man was<br>sworn in as the chief executive of his country. By his side<br>stood his predecessor, a famous general who, fifteen years<br>earlier, had commanded his nation&#x2019;s armed forces in a war<br>that resulted in the defeat of Germany. The young leader<br>was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He spent the next<br>fi ve hours watching parades in his honor and stayed up<br>celebrating until three o&#x2019;clock in the morning.<br>You know who I&#x2019;m describing, right?<br><br>It&#x2019;s January 30, 1933, and I&#x2019;m describing Adolf Hitler and not,<br>as most people would assume, John F. Kennedy.<br>The point is, we make assumptions. We make assumptions<br>about the world around us based on sometimes incomplete or false<br>information. In this case, the information I offered was incomplete.<br>Many of you were convinced that I was describing John F. Kennedy<br>until I added one minor little detail: the date.<br><br>This is important because our behavior is affected by our assumptions<br>or our perceived truths. We make decisions based on<br>what we <i>think </i>we know. It wasn&#x2019;t too long ago that the majority of<br>people believed the world was flat. This perceived truth impacted behavior. <br>During this period, there was very little exploration. People<br>feared that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge<br>of the earth. So for the most part they stayed put. It wasn&#x2019;t until<br>that minor detail was revealed&#x2014;the world is round&#x2014;that behaviors<br>changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, societies<br>began to traverse the planet. Trade routes were established; spices<br>were traded. New ideas, like mathematics, were shared between societies<br>which unleashed all kinds of innovations and advancements.<br>The correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race<br>forward.<br><br>Now consider how organizations are formed and how decisions<br>are made. Do we really know why some organizations succeed and<br>why others don&#x2019;t, or do we just assume? No matter your defi nition<br>of success&#x2014;hitting a target stock price, making a certain amount<br>of money, meeting a revenue or profi t goal, getting a big promotion,<br>starting your own company, feeding the poor, winning public<br>office&#x2014;how we go about achieving our goals is very similar. Some<br>of us just wing it, but most of us try to at least gather some data so<br>we can make educated decisions. Sometimes this gathering process<br>is formal&#x2014;like conducting polls or market research. And<br>sometimes it&#x2019;s informal, like asking our friends and colleagues for<br>advice or looking back on our own personal experience to provide<br>some perspective. Regardless of the process or the goals, we all want<br>to make educated decisions. More importantly, we all want to make<br>the <i>right </i>decisions.<br><br>As we all know, however, not all decisions work out to be the<br>right ones, regardless of the amount of data we collect. Sometimes<br>the impact of those wrong decisions is minor, and sometimes it can<br>be catastrophic. Whatever the result, we make decisions based on a<br>perception of the world that may not, in fact, be completely accurate.<br>Just as so many were certain that I was describing John F.<br>Kennedy at the beginning of this section. You were certain you were<br>right. You might even have bet money on it&#x2014;a behavior based on<br>an assumption. Certain, that is, until I offered that little detail of<br>the date.<br><br>Not only bad decisions are made on false assumptions. Sometimes<br>when things go right, we think we know why, but do we really?<br>That the result went the way you wanted does not mean you<br>can repeat it over and over. I have a friend who invests some of his<br>own money. Whenever he does well, it&#x2019;s because of his brains and<br>ability to pick the right stocks, at least according to him. But when<br>he loses money, he always blames the market. I have no issue with<br>either line of logic, but either his success and failure hinge upon his<br>own prescience and blindness or they hinge upon good and bad<br>luck. But it can&#x2019;t be both.<br><br>So how can we ensure that all our decisions will yield the best<br>results for reasons that are fully within our control? Logic dictates<br>that more information and data are key. And that&#x2019;s exactly what<br>we do. We read books, attend conferences, listen to podcasts and<br>ask friends and colleagues&#x2014;all with the purpose of finding out<br>more so we can figure out what to do or how to act. The problem<br>is, we&#x2019;ve all been in situations in which we have all the data and get<br>lots of good advice but things still don&#x2019;t go quite right. Or maybe<br>the impact lasted for only a short time, or something happened<br>that we could not foresee. A quick note to all of you who correctly<br>guessed Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the section: the details I<br>gave are the same for both Hitler and John F. Kennedy, it could have<br>been either. You have to be careful what you think you know. Assumptions,<br>you see, even when based on sound research, can lead<br>us astray.<br><br>Intuitively we understand this. We understand that even with<br>mountains of data and good advice, if things don&#x2019;t go as expected,<br>it&#x2019;s probably because we missed one, sometimes small but vital detail.<br>In these cases, we go back to all our sources, maybe seek out<br>some new ones, and try to figure out what to do, and the whole<br>process begins again. More data, however, doesn&#x2019;t always help, especially<br>if a flawed assumption set the whole process in motion in<br>the fi rst place. There are other factors that must be considered, factors<br>that exist outside of our rational, analytical, informationhungry<br>brains.<br><br>There are times in which we had no data or we chose to ignore<br>the advice or information at hand and just went with our gut and<br>things worked out just fine, sometimes even better than expected.<br>This dance between gut and rational decision-making pretty much<br>covers how we conduct business and even live our lives. We can<br>continue to slice and dice all the options in every direction, but at<br>the end of all the good advice and all the compelling evidence, we&#x2019;re<br>left where we started: how to explain or decide a course of action<br>that yields a desired effect that is repeatable. How can we have 20/20<br>foresight?<br><br>There is a wonderful story of a group of American car executives<br>who went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line. At the<br>end of the line, the doors were put on the hinges, the same as in<br>America. But something was missing. In the United States, a line<br>worker would take a rubber mallet and tap the edges of the door to<br>ensure that it fit perfectly. In Japan, that job didn&#x2019;t seem to exist.<br>Confused, the American auto executives asked at what point they<br>made sure the door fit perfectly. Their Japanese guide looked at<br>them and smiled sheepishly. &#x201c;We make sure it fits when we design<br>it.&#x201d; In the Japanese auto plant, they didn&#x2019;t examine the problem<br>and accumulate data to figure out the best solution&#x2014;they engineered<br>the outcome they wanted from the beginning. If they didn&#x2019;t<br>achieve their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a<br>decision they made at the start of the process.<br><br>At the end of the day, the doors on the American-made and<br>Japanese-made cars appeared to fit when each rolled off the assembly<br>line. Except the Japanese didn&#x2019;t need to employ someone to<br>hammer doors, nor did they need to buy any mallets. More importantly,<br>the Japanese doors are likely to last longer and maybe even<br>be more structurally sound in an accident. All this for no other<br>reason than they ensured the pieces fit from the start.<br><br>What the American automakers did with their rubber mallets is<br>a metaphor for how so many people and organizations lead. When<br>faced with a result that doesn&#x2019;t go according to plan, a series of<br>perfectly effective short-term tactics are used until the desired out-<br>come is achieved. But how structurally sound are those solutions?<br>So many organizations function in a world of tangible goals and the<br>mallets to achieve them. The ones that achieve more, the ones that<br>get more out of fewer people and fewer resources, the ones with an<br>outsized amount of infl uence, however, build products and companies<br>and even recruit people that all fit based on the original<br>intention. Even though the outcome may look the same, great leaders<br>understand the value in the things we cannot see.<br><br>Every instruction we give, every course of action we set, every<br>result we desire, starts with the same thing: a decision. There are<br>those who decide to manipulate the door to fit to achieve the desired<br>result and there are those who start from somewhere very<br>different. Though both courses of action may yield similar shortterm<br>results, it is what we can&#x2019;t see that makes long-term success<br>more predictable for only one. The one that understood why the<br>doors need to fit by design and not by default.</p><h2>The Immortal Game: A History of Chess, or How 32 Carved Pieces on a Board Illuminated Our Understanding of War, Art, Science and the Human Brain</h2><p>Why has one game, alone among the thousands of games invented and played throughout human history, not only survived but thrived within every culture it has touched? What is it about its thirty-two figurative pieces, moving about its sixty-four black and white squares according to very simple rules, that has captivated people for nearly 1,500 years? Why has it driven some of its greatest players into paranoia and madness, and yet is hailed as a remarkably powerful intellectual tool?<br><br>Nearly everyone has played chess at some point in their lives. Its rules and pieces have served as a metaphor for society, influencing military strategy, mathematics, artificial intelligence, and literature and the arts. It has been condemned as the devil&#x2019;s game by popes, rabbis, and imams, and lauded as a guide to proper living by other popes, rabbis, and imams. Marcel Duchamp was so absorbed in the game that he ignored his wife on their honeymoon. Caliph Muhammad al-Amin lost his throne (and his head) trying to checkmate a courtier. Ben Franklin used the game as a cover for secret diplomacy.<br><br>In his wide-ranging and ever-fascinating examination of chess, David Shenk gleefully unearths the hidden history of a game that seems so simple yet contains infinity. From its invention somewhere in India around 500 A.D., to its enthusiastic adoption by the Persians and its spread by Islamic warriors, to its remarkable use as a moral guide in the Middle Ages and its political utility in the Enlightenment, to its crucial importance in the birth of cognitive science and its key role in the aesthetic of modernism in twentieth-century art, to its twenty-first-century importance in the development of artificial intelligence and use as a teaching tool in inner-city America, chess has been a remarkably omnipresent factor in the development of civilization.</p><p><p>DAVID SHENK is a national-bestselling author of four previous books, including<i> The Forgetting</i> and<i> Data Smog</i>, and a contributor to<i> National Geographic</i>, <i>Gourmet</i>,<i> Harper&#x2019;s</i>,<i> The New Yorker</i>, NPR, and<i> </i>PBS.<i> The Forgetting </i>was hailed by John Bayley as &#x201c;the definitive work on Alzheimer&#x2019;s,&#x201d; and subsequently inspired an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning PBS film of the same name. Shenk frequently lectures on issues of health, aging, and technology, and has advised the President&#x2019;s Council on Bioethics. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>1.<br><br>"UNDERSTANDING IS THE ESSENTIAL WEAPON"<br>Chess and Our Origins<br><i>When Sissa had invented chess and produced it to King Shihram, the latter was filled with amazement and joy. He ordered that it should be preserved in the temples, and held it the best thing that he knew as a training in the art of war, a glory to religion and the world, and the foundation of all justice.<br></i>&#x2014;<i>ibn Khallikan, thirteenth century</i><br>Stories do not exist to tell the facts, but to convey the truth. It is said that in ancient India, a queen had designated her only son as heir to the throne. When the son was assassinated, the queen's council searched for the proper way to convey the tragic news to her. They approached a philosopher with their predicament. He sat for three days in silent thought, and then said: "Summon a carpenter with wood of two colors, white and black."<br><br>The carpenter came. The philosopher instructed him to carve thirty-two small figurines from the wood. After this was done, the philosopher said to the carpenter, "Bring me tanned leather," and directed him to cut it into the shape of a square and to etch it with sixty-four smaller squares.<br><br>He then arranged the pieces on the board and studied them silently. Finally, he turned to his disciple and announced, "This is war without bloodshed." He explained the game's rules and the two began to play. Word quickly spread about the mysterious new invention, and the queen herself summoned the philosopher for a demonstration. She sat quietly, watching the philosopher and his student play a game. When it was over, one side having checkmated the other, the queen understood the intended message. She turned to the philosopher and said, "My son is dead."<br><br>"You have said it," he replied.<br><br>The queen turned to the doorkeeper and said, "Let the people enter to comfort me."<br><br>The annals of ancient poetry and weathered prose are filled with many such evocative chess stories, stretched over 1,400 years. Over and over, chess was said to have been invented to explain the unexplainable, to make visible the purely abstract, to see simple truths in complex worlds. Pythagoras, the ancient mathematician heralded as the father of numbers, was supposed to have created the game to convey the abstract realities of mathematics. The Greek warrior Palamedes, commander of troops at the siege of Troy, purportedly invented chess as a demonstration of the art of battle positions. Moses, in his posture as Jewish sage, was said to have invented it as a part of an all-purpose educational package, along with astronomy, astrology, and the alphabet.<br><br>Chess was also considered a window into other people's unique thoughts. There is the legend of the great medieval rebbe, also a cunning chess player, whose son had been taken away as a young boy and never found. Many decades later, the rebbe was granted an audience with the pope. The two spoke for a while, and then decided to play a game of chess. In their game the pope played a very unusual combination of moves which, to any other opponent, would have been astonishing and overpowering. But the strange combination was not new to the rebbe; he had invented it, in fact, and had shared it only with his young son. The pope, they both instantly realized, was the rebbe's long lost child.<br><br>And there are hundreds&#x2014;maybe thousands&#x2014;more. Hearing these stories, we care less about whether they are completely true and more about what they say. Myths, said Joseph Campbell, "represent that wisdom of the species by which man has weathered the millenniums." Chess myths, in particular, tell us first that chess goes way, way back, and that it has always been regarded not just as a way to pass the time, but also as a powerful tool for explanation and understanding. While chess is ostensibly about war, it has for 1,400 years been deployed as a metaphor to explore everything from romantic love to economics. Historians routinely stumble across chess stories from nearly every culture and era&#x2014;stories dealing with class consciousness, free will, political struggle, the frontiers of the mind, the mystery of the divine, the nature of competition, and, perhaps most fundamentally, the emergence of a world where brains often overcome brawn. One need not have any passion for the game itself to be utterly captivated by its centuries of compelling tales, and to appreciate its importance as a thought tool for an emerging civilization. Chess is a teaching and learning instrument older than chalkboards, printed books, the compass, and the telescope.<br><br>As a miniature reflection of society, it was also considered a moral guidepost. Yet another myth has chess invented to cure the cruelty of Evil-Merodach, a vile Babylonian king from the sixth century b.c. who murdered his father King Nebuchadnezzar and then disposed of his body by chopping it into three hundred pieces and feeding the pieces to three hundred vultures. Desperate to curb the brutality of his new leader, the wise man Xerxes created chess in order to instill virtues and transform him into a just and moral ruler: Here is how a king behaves toward his subjects, and here is how his grateful subjects defend their just king . . . <br><br>Separately, each chess myth conveys a thousand truths about a particular moment in time where a society longed to understand something difficult about its own past&#x2014;the source of some idea or tool or tradition. Taken together, they document our quest to understand&#x2014;and explain&#x2014;abstraction and complexity in the world around us. The paradox of illuminating complexity is that it is inherently difficult to do so without erasing all of the nuance. As our developing civilization faced more intricate facts and ideas in the early Middle Ages, this was a fundamental challenge: to find a way to represent dense truths without washing out their essence. (This ancient challenge is, of course, also very contemporary, and, as we will see, makes chess fundamentally relevant in the Age of Information.)<br>***<br>When and how and why was chess invented? The very oldest chess myths point toward its actual origins. One story portrays two successive Indian kings, Hashran and Balhait. The first asked his sage to invent a game symbolizing man's dependence on destiny and fate; he invented nard, the dice-based predecessor to backgammon. The subsequent monarch needed a game which would embrace his belief in free will and intelligence. "At this time chess was invented," reads an ancient text, "which the King preferred to nard, because in this game skill always succeeds against ignorance. He made mathematical calculations on chess, and wrote a book on it. . . . He often played chess with the wise men of his court, and it was he who represented the pieces by the figures of men and animals, and assigned them grades and ranks. . . ."<br><br>"He also made of this game a kind of allegory of the heavenly bodies (the seven planets and the twelve zodiacal signs), and dedicated each piece to a star. The game of chess became a school of government and defense; it was consulted in time of war, when military tactics were about to be employed, to study the more or less rapid movements of troops."<br><br>King Balhait's wide-ranging list of the game's uses has a connecting thread: chess as a demonstration device, a touchstone for abstract ideas. The reference to "mathematical calculations" is particularly noteworthy, as math comes up over and over again in many of the oldest chess legends. One tale, known as "The Doubling of the Squares," tells of a king presented with an intriguing new sixty-four-square board game by his court philosopher. The king is so delighted by chess that he invites the inventor to name his own reward.<br><br><i>Oh, I don't want much</i>, replies the philosopher, pointing to the chessboard. <i>Just give me one grain of wheat for the first square of the board, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, and so on, doubling the number of grains for each successive square, up to the sixty-fourth square.</i><br><br>The king is shocked, and even insulted, by what seems like such a modest request. He doesn't realize that through the hidden power of geometric progression, his court philosopher has just requested 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (eighteen <i>quintillion</i>) grains of wheat--more than exists on the entire planet. The king has not only just been given a fascinating new game; he's also been treated to a powerful numbers lesson.<br><br>This widely repeated story is obviously apocryphal, but the facts of geometric progression are real. Such mathematical concepts were crucial to the advancement of technology and civilization--but were useless unless they could be understood. The advancement of big ideas required not just clever inventors, but also great teachers and vivid presentation vehicles.<br><br>That's apparently where chess came in: it used the highly accessible idea of war to convey far less concrete ideas. Chess was, in a sense, medieval presentation software&#x2014;the PowerPoint of the Middle Ages. It was a customizable platform for poets, philosophers, and other intellectuals to explore and present a wide array of complex ideas in a visual and compelling way.<br><br>The game, in reality, was not invented all at once, in a fit of inspiration by a single king, general, philosopher, or court wizard. Rather, it was almost certainly (like the Bible and the Internet) the result of years of tinkering by a large, decentralized group, a slow achievement of collective intelligence. After what might have been centuries of tinkering, <i>chatrang</i>, the first true version of what we now call chess, finally emerged in Persia sometime during the fifth or sixth century. It was a two-player war game with thirty-two pieces on a sixty-four-square board: sixteen emerald men on one end and sixteen ruby-red men on the other. Each army was equipped with one King, one Minister (where the Qu...</p><h2>Azumanga Daioh Omnibus Volume 1</h2><p>High school: a time of friends, memories... and biting cats? Leering teachers? And is that penguin carrying a tray?! Welcome to Azumanga Daioh, the acclaimed story from writer/illustrator Kiyohiko Azuma (Yotsuba&amp;!) about the humor and wonder of teenage life. Join the brainy Chiyo-chan, spaced-out Osaka, over-the-top Tomo, soft-spoken Sakaki, hair-trigger Yomi and brash Kagura as they fumble their way toward graduation and the future, collected here for the first time in a single volume.</p><p>Four previously published volumes of this charmingly whimsical manga are assembled under one cover, collecting a huge number of four-panel strips and the occasional entry in more traditional comic style. Taken as a whole, the sheer volume of material builds a world that makes up for the slightness of the individual strips as we follow four high school girls to graduation. Each chapter, named for a month, focuses on typical events of the season, and the humor comes through a variety of approaches: physical comedy, contrasting expectations, goofy behavior, exaggerated literalism and the occasional dreamy surrealism. The girls have defining characteristics and hairstyles. The standout is brainy 10-year-old Chiyo, who closely resembles the title character from Azuma's later work <i>Yotsuba&amp;!</i>. Meanwhile, the freedom of action of an incompetent teacher who inappropriately behaves like a student herself is shown as oddly attractive. The story line is very Japanese, with its emphasis on structure and school ritual. Some of the Americanizations, like having an Osaka student speak Brooklynese, are necessary but slightly jarring. The omnibus is an ideal presentation for the series and should bring new readers to the franchise. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But according to historians and anthropologists, their semi-nomadic culture disappeared at the end of the nineteenth century, and no one has seen the gauchos since. Until now.<br><br>Twenty-five years ago, the government of Chile began building a road into Chilean Patagonia, one of the least-populated regions in the world. In 1995, when Nick Reding traveled down that still-unfinished road into an unmapped river valley, he found himself in a closed chapter of history: a last, undetected, and unexplored outpost of gauchos so isolated that many of them, some of whom are boys as young as thirteen, still live completely alone with their herds, hours on horseback from the nearest neighbors. In 1998, Nick returned to the valley to witness what happens when time catches up to a people whom history has forgotten. <br><br>Reding&#x2019;s account of the ten months he spent in Middle Cisnes, Patagonia, is a riveting, novelistic exploration of the longing for change by a people and a culture that, according to history books and the Chilean government, do not even exist. There&#x2019;s Duck, the alcoholic with whom Reding lives and who takes Reding on long cattle drives, teaching him to ride and work as gauchos have for centuries; Duck&#x2019;s wife, Edith, who is convinced she is reliving the life of her estranged mother, who was, according to legend, wed to the Devil; John of the Cows, a famed cattle thief wanted for murder who takes Reding to the secret place in the mountains where he hides his stolen stock; and Don Tito and Alfredo, two brothers who are unsure of their age and communicate with each other through smoke signals. <br><br>In Middle Cisnes, Reding watches a singular&#x2014;and ultimately murderous&#x2014;conflict take hold between those who want to trade life in the nineteenth century for life in the twenty-first and those who want to keep living as gauchos have for hundreds of years. What all of them understand is the near impossibility of a journey through a world where everything from the fierce landscape to a ravaging disease conspires against them, a journey whose terminus&#x2014;the Outside, the only town in central Patagonia&#x2019;s 42,000 square miles&#x2014;is a place where the gauchos are not only ill-equipped to live, but clearly unwelcome. <br><br><b>The Last Cowboys at the End of the World </b>is a story of regeneration through violence and tragedy. When the people of Middle Cisnes finally try to take their place in the modern world, the results are as horrifying and surprising as they are heroic. In the collision of the gaucho past, our present, and an unknown future, Nick Reding captures a moment in time that we have never before seen and will never see again.</p><p>Some people will go to the ends of the earth for a good story; Nick Reding went to the end of the road, which turned out to be one and the same. When the Pan American Highway was extended into Chilean Patagonia, it exposed a people long believed to be extinct--the gauchos. While the gauchos had struggled for centuries with the hantavirus, extreme isolation, and visits by the devil, what the road brought was truly overwhelming. Reding befriends the likes of Duck, an alcoholic slowly breaking from the pressure of the outside; John of the Cows, a cattle thief on the lam; and Don Luis, an aging gaucho with terrific stories to tell. From its dramatic opening to its turbulent end, this elegant, brutal, and funny dispatch from one of the world's most forlorn places attempts to answer the inconceivable: What happens when you suddenly find yourself two centuries in the future? <i>--Lesley Reed</i>&#x201c;What a terrific book! <b>The Last Cowboys at the End of the World</b> read like a dream, gave me enormous pleasure, and broke my heart.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;William Kittredge, author of <b>The Nature of Generosity</b> and <b>The Last Best Place</b></p><h2>Stephenson&#39;s Rocket Manual: 1829 onwards (Owners&#39; Workshop Manual)</h2><p><p>Stephenson's Rocket is one of the most famous steam locomotives of all time. Designed by Robert Stephenson, with input from this father, George, Rocket set the fundamental design template for almost all the locomotives that followed it. The original locomotive is owned by the National Railway Museum, and is currently on display at the Science Museum in London. Two working replicas of the locomotive have been built. The most advanced steam engine of its time, Rocket was built in 1829 for the Rainhill Trials held by the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway (LMR) in order to evaluate locomotive designs and choose the best one for use on this new railway. Five locomotives took part in the trials and Rocket was chosen as the winning design. Published in association with the Science Museum, this manual, illustrated with a wealth of photographs and technical drawings, provides a fascinating insight into the design, construction and operation of Rocket.</p></p><p>Richard Gibbon, now retired after working for many years for the National Railway Museum as Head of Engineering Collections, has studied Rocket and its history in greater detail than anyone else and has been involved with the operation of the two replicas.</p><h2>The Daily Bible� Compact Edition</h2><p><p>The original <i>Daily Bible in Chronological Order</i>, with more than half a million copies in print, now comes in a handy size.

A sweeping epic saga of corruption, greed, treachery, and sin, <em>The Family</em> is the ultimate crowning achievement of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling novelist who gave the world <em>The Godfather</em>, arguably the greatest Mafia crime novel ever written.&nbsp; In <em>The Family</em>, Puzo&#x2014;whom the <em>Washington Post</em> calls, &#x201c;A serious American talent&#x201d;&#x2014;plunges reader into the colorful tumult of the Italian Renaissance, immersing them in the roiling intrigues and deadly affairs of the remarkable family whose name has always been synonymous with power, corruption, poison, and murder: the infamous Borgias.<br></p></p><p><p>What is a family? Mario Puzo first answered that question, unforgettably, in his landmark bestseller <em>The Godfather;</em> with the creation of the Corleones he forever redefined the concept of blood loyalty. Now, thirty years later, Puzo enriches us all with his ultimate vision of the subject, in a masterpiece that crowns his remarkable career: the story of the greatest crime family in Italian history -- the Borgias.</p><p>In <em>The Family,</em> this singular novelist transports his readers back to fifteenth-century Rome and reveals the extravagance and intrigue of the Vatican as surely as he once revealed the secrets of the Mafia. At the story's center is Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI, a man whose lustful appetites for power, luxury, and women were matched only by his consuming love of family. Surrounding him are his extraordinary children: the simple, unloved Jofre; the irascible, heartless Juan; the beautiful, strong-willed Lucrezia; and the passionate warrior Cesare, Machiavelli's friend and inspiration. Their intermingled stories constitute a symphony of human emotion and behavior, from pride to romance to jealousy to betrayal and murderous rage. And their time, place, and characters are recaptured in all their earthy, human grandeur, with the unerring insight and compassion that were Mario Puzo's great gifts.</p><p>A labor of love two decades in the making, <em>The Family</em> marks the final triumph of one of the greatest storytellers of our time.</p><p>Mario Puzo was the author of the international bestseller <em>The Godfather</em> and cowrote the screenplays for the Academy Award-winning trio of films based on the book. Puzo's other books include <em>The Last Don</em> and <em>Omerta</em>, both <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers.</p></p><h2>Knight of Shadows</h2><p>A fantasy adventure relates the tale of a sometimes murderous family of wizards and the alternate worlds they inhabit</p><p><p><strong>Roger Zelazny</strong> burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for <em>Lord of Light</em>, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular <em>Amber</em> series, <em>Nine Princes in Amber.</em> In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career. He died on June 14, 1995.</p>This is the ninth book in the popular Amber series; there are ten books and five short stories altogether. Amber is another plane of existence, an alternate universe, first among many, with magic, ghosts, strange creatures, and magical patterns. Zelazny reads in a deep voice so laid-back that he sounds on the verge of sleep. However, it&#39;s oddly effective. D.W.

Goodrick-Clarke's powerful and timely book traces the intellectual roots of Nazism back to a number of influential occult and millenarian sects in the Habsburg Empire during its waning years. These sects combined notions of popular nationalism with an advocacy of Aryan racism and a proclaimed need for German world-rule.</p> <p>This book provides the first serious account of the way in which Nazism was influenced by powerful millenarian and occult sects that thrived in Germany and Austria almost fifty years before the rise to power of Adolf Hitler.</p> <p>These millenarian sects (principally the Ariosophists) espoused a mixture of popular nationalism, Aryan racism, and occultism to support their advocacy of German world-rule. Over time their ideas and symbols, filtered through nationalist-racist groups associated with the infant Nazi party, came to exert a strong influence on Himmler's SS.</p> <p>The fantasies thus fueled were played out with terrifying consequences in the realities structured into the Third Reich: Auschwitz, Sobibor, and Treblinka, the hellish museums of Nazi apocalypse, had psychic roots reaching back to millenial visions of occult sects. Beyond what the TImes Literary Supplement calls an intriguing study of apocalyptic fantasies, this bizarre and fascinating story contains lessons we cannot afford to ignore.</p></p><p>This book traces the intellectual roots of Nazism back to a number of influential occult and millenarian sects in the Hapsburg Empire during its warning years.<p><b>Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke</b> is the author of several books on ideology and the Western esoteric tradition, including <i>Hitler&#x2019;s Priestess</i> and <i>The Occult Roots of Nazism</i>, which has remained in print since its publication in 1985 and has been translated into eight languages.

In Herfsttjj der Middeleeuwen, he recalled the waning years of the Middle Ages--the low countries in northern Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries--and argued against those who claimed that human belief systems remain the same even if contexts change. His account rested not on historical fact, but on the emotions and ambitions of the people as expressed through the art and literature of their culture. Many people treated the book as groundbreaking work, and it was translated into English in 1924. This new translation is a complete, more direct version of the original and allows modern readers a full appreciation of life in an era rarely revisited.Johan Huizinga is one of the most imporatant historians of the twentieth century. He was Professor of General History at the University of Leyden. While he is best-known for this book, his biography, ERASMUS OF ROTTERDAM, is unsurpassed.</p><h2>What We Talk About When We Talk About God</h2><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Rob Bell, whom <em>The New Yorker</em> describes as &#x201c;one of the most influential Christian leaders in the country,&#x201d; does for the concept of God what he did for heaven and hell in his book <em>Love Wins</em>: He shows how traditional ideas have grown stale and dysfunctional and how to return vitality and vibrancy to lives of faith today.<br><br>Pastor Rob Bell explains why both culture and the church resist talking about God, and shows how we can reconnect with the God who is pulling us forward into a better future.

For many of us, it is the single greatest challenge in every area of our lives. We have been taught that anger itself is a sin and should be avoided at all costs. However, anger is also understood to be &#39;nature&#39;s way&#39; of preparing man to respond in times of danger. How then do we go about bringing this volatile emotion under the Lordship of Jesus Christ? Gary Chapman gives us the perfect tool to answer this and many other questions in The Other Side of Love. In this book, he takes a fresh look at the origin and purpose of anger. Asserting that anger is rooted in the holy nature of God, he reverently explains that anger flows from God&#39;s holiness and love. Gary Chapman draws on his extensive counseling experience to instruct us how to positively process our anger. This will help us to create and further cultivate healthy relationships. Helpful study questions for group or personal use conclude each chapter. Don&#39;t let anger get the best of you. Victory begins with understanding. Now is the time to make this critical investment in your walk with Christ.</p><p>What's So Loving About Anger? <p> Many of us believe anger is a sinful emotion of which we should be ashamed. We want to be loving, and we perceive our potentially volatile feelings to be the opposite of love. But as best-selling author Gary Chapman explains, this much-misunderstood emotion necessarily goes hand-in-hand with love. Its fundamental purpose is not to tear down, but to motivate us to positive, loving action that will leave things better than we found them. </p><p> In The Other Side of Love, Chapman helps sort out the confusion, teaching how you can process anger in a constructive, godly manner. </p><p> Filled with insignts and techniques that have helped hundreds of individuals and families to find a better way to deal with anger, The Other Side of Love will help you to understand the source of your anger---and guide it toward productive purposes. </p><p> Includes study questions ideal for use by individuals or groups! </p><p>SOURCE1: Moody Magazine, September/October 1999 REVIEW1: "...Chapman wrestles with biblical content in a way that is sound and valuable, illu strated with counseling scenarios and dialogues.

Stine brings back his most beloved characters&#x2015;the cheerleaders of Shadyside High.</p><p>The cheerleading squad at Shadyside has always been strong, but now there are rumors that lack of funds may mean the end of cheerleading at Shadyside. That would be a shame for Heather Wyatt, who has just transferred from her old school, where she was a star, and is eager to join the squad. There&#x2019;s only one other girl who stands in her way&#x2015;rich, spoiled Devra Dalby, who is also trying out for the one open slot. The competition to join the squad is anything but friendly&#x2015;and it ends in murder. Will Heather make the squad&#x2015;if there's even a squad anymore&#x2015;or will she end up dead?</p><p>Packed with screams and guaranteed to send a shiver up your spine, <i>Give Me a K-I-L-L</i> is a terrifying installment in Stine's bestselling Fear Street series.</p></p><p>R.L. STINE is one of the bestselling children&#x2019;s authors in history with more than 400 million books sold to date. In 1989, Stine created the Fear Street series, one of the bestselling young adult book series in history with 80 million copies sold worldwide. He is also the author of the bestselling children&#x2019;s series Goosebumps, which began in 1992 and has sold 300 million copies around the world. The Goosebumps series was made into a feature film starring Jack Black as R.L. Stine.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Gretchen Page has just transferred to Shadyside High School. Seeking a fresh start after her parents' recent divorce but missing her best friend, Gretchen finds it hard to make friends. The cocaptain of the cheerleader squad at her former school, Gretchen is looking forward to trying out for a spot on the Shadyside team and hopefully befriending the squad members in the process. Unfortunately, Devra Dalby, last year's cheerleading alternate, also has her eye on the open place in the group. And when the two girls go head-to-head, Gretchen realizes that Devra may be much more than the rich, spoiled high school girl she seems&#x2014;she may even be deadly. A new book in Stine's revival of the "Fear Street" series, this murder mystery is told from Gretchen's point of view; the third-person narration sometimes calls into question the reliability of the protagonist, especially when it presents the reactions of secondary characters, such as Gretchen's mother and Devra. While this is not as layered as many modern young adult works, rapid twists and turns in the plot will keep teens guessing, and generous foreshadowing and suspense will have them on the edge of their seats. VERDICT With more violence and sexual tension than in the original series, as well as a classic Stine ending, this is a worthy addition to the chronicles of the Shadyside cheerleaders, for new readers and longtime lovers alike.&#x2014;Maggie Mason Smith, Clemson University, SC</p><h2>Invisible Ink: A Practical Guide to Building Stories That Resonate</h2><p>Acclaimed by successful screenwriters and authors, Invisible Ink is a helpful, accessible guide to the essential elements of the best storytelling.

Nuns were the first feminists, argues Fialka. They became the nation's first cadre of independent, professional women. Some nursed, some taught, and many created and managed new charitable organizations, including large hospitals and colleges. <br><br>In the 1800s nuns moved west with the frontier, often starting the first hospitals and schools in immigrant communities. They provided aid and service in the Chicago fire, cared for orphans and prostitutes in the California Gold Rush and brought professional nursing skills to field hospitals run by both armies in the Civil War. Their work was often done in the face of intimidation from such groups as the Know Nothings and the Ku Klux Klan.<br><br>In the 1900s they built the nation's largest private school and hospital systems and brought the Catholic Church into the civil rights movement. As their numbers began to decline in the 1970s, many sisters were forced to take professional jobs as lawyers, probation workers, managers and hospital executives because their salaries were needed to support older nuns, many of whom lacked a pension system. Currently there are about 75,000 sisters in America, down from 204,000 in 1968. Their median age is sixty-nine. <br><br>In <i>Sisters, </i>Fialka<i> </i>reveals the strength of the spiritual capital and the unprecedented reach of the caring institutions that religious women created in America.<br></p><p><p>Praise for <i>Sisters</i></p><p>"<i>Sisters</i>'s strength is Fialka's ability to put flesh and blood into the accounts of the lives and work of sisters and to show through these lives the immense contribution to American society."<br>---<i>National Catholic Reporter</i></p><p>"Fialka tells [the nuns'] story passionately, analyzing their remarkable contributions to education, health care, social reform, and civil rights."<br>---<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>"Fialka is bent on recovering those thrilling days of yesteryear when flocks of sisters . . . pushed beyond the settled boundaries of nineteenth-century America to aid in the civilizing of a continent."<br>---Kenneth L.

Chilam Balam, literally, "jaguar priest," is taken from the name of a fifteendi-century Mayan priest. The Chilam Balarn consists mainly of prophecies that depict the spiritual and bodily decline of Mayan culture, a decline of monumental proportions and the impending catastrophe of the conquest.

Brilliant, classic high fantasy on one hand and yet unique and unpredictable on the other. So many twists that I did not in the slightest see coming, and which developed or resolved situations perfectly. Genius storytelling revealing complete mastery of poor defenceless reader emotions as well as fabulous world-building and skillfull character development.

If you&#39;re hesitating to finish this trilogy for fear it could let you down, stop messing about right now and get on with it.

The Book Bag ... the final episode of the powerful and all-consuming The Grisha sequence -- Julia Eccleshare Love Reading Ruin and Rising left me teary-eyed and contented.

Falling Books It&#39;s difficult to put the beauty of this series into words, as it has to be read in its entirety to be fully appreciated. The careful weaving of magic, fantasy and fairytale comes to a close with a finale that feels like the perfect ending for all involved. There are surprises galore and more than a few emotional, heart-wrenching moments, as the loose ends are tied up with graceful finesse. I cannot praise this series highly enough, so don&#39;t be deterred by the YA genre tag - it truly does appeal to all ages. Book Chick City Praise for Leigh Bardugo: I was away on the ships and wandering through Ravka with Alina and Mal, I was on the receiving end of his kisses and his annoyances. I felt the sun warm the pages whenever Alina summoned and I felt the fear when The Darkling was around. There is nothing I don&#39;t love about the world in which the Grisha trilogy is set and I cannot wait until next year to see how this series is going to conclude. Readaraptor Praise for Leigh Bardugo:Leigh is a writer of the best kind because she loves her characters and the world they live in and makes a reader jealous that they can&#39;t visit it. There is magic in these pages. Sister Spooky Praise for Leigh Bardugo: I wrote a piece here gushing about why the Grisha series is so different and so special. There are many small reasons that all come together to create the awesomeness. But there are also many more that I can&#39;t even explain. Maybe it is different because it is just magic. It has the most exquisitely constructed world, the best-written characters, the most amazing writing and storyline. And it always always always leaves me desperate for more. It always leaves me aching, foaming at the mouth, for more: right now. And that, perhaps, is why it is so special. It is magic. It is beautiful. It is perfect. Well, except for that cliffhanger. How am I meant to make it a whole year with that hanging over my head?! The Book-Addicted Girl Praise for Leigh Bardugo: Leigh Bardugo, you sure know how to involve your readers and make them an emotional wreck. Siege and Storm is an enthralling sequel that seriously ups the game and expectations of the reader. It is written so beautifully that is flows flawlessly while keeping the magic alive in the readers mind. If you want to read a fantasy series that has a truly unique world then read this series. Read and Write and Read Some More Praise for Leigh Bardugo:...a strong and satisfying sequel solidifying my belief that The Grisha Trilogy will go down as one of my favourite series of all time. Jess Hearts Books Praise for the Grisha trilogy: It is one of those series which as a YA reader is a must read. It is series which grabs hold of you by the neck and wrings every emotion out until you are a blabbering, quivering, drooling mess on your sofa. It is high fantasy at its best and I can guarantee that you will not regret picking up this book.

What time? Do you have the proper ingredients?&nbsp; English muffins? Marmalade, et cetera?" We'd never shaken the habit of testing one another. <br><br>"Of course, you spoiled brat. Come at ten, you shall have ginger marmalade from Bloomingdale's, <i>fresh</i> orange juice I shall squeeze personally, boiled eggs&#x2014;your customary five and a half minutes. And of course there will be fascinating conversation."<br><br>"Might I have a clue?" We'd also become adept at approaching each other with oblique, occasionally fake, courtesy.<br><br>Silence, as I'd expected. Then: "Okay, do you have a good gynecologist?"<br><br>My silence. "Of course. What for?"<br><br>"Brooke, listen." She was suddenly singing. "I have never ever been so happy in my life&#x2014;I think I'm pregnant."<br><br>"<i>What</i>?" I was predictably stunned, but less by that possibility than by her confiding in me. "How the hell did you get pregnant?"<br><br>"Oh," she said, giggling, "probably from a toilet seat." <br><br>"Bridget. For God's sake, have you gone mad? I mean, how can you possibly be twenty-one years old and reasonably, one hopes, <i>reasonably</i> intelligent and not have been to a&#x2014;"<br><br>"Brooke, listen." She was positively frenzied with elation. "Listen, it's entirely possible that I want to get married, I'm so in love. Do you hear me? <i>Married</i>!"<br><br>This conversation was moving just out of my reach, like a smoke ring. All I could say was "Yes. I see what you mean about breakfast&#x2014;yes, indeed. Might one ask who the expectant father is? No, never mind."<br><br>"Ten o'clock tomorrow. What's he like, is he nice, does he hurt?" I knew she meant the gynecologist.<br><br>"Yes, no, never mind. Actually he's from India&#x2014;nice blend of exotic and imperturbable. Forget it, go to sleep."<br><br>"Okay, see you in the morning. Farewell." Farewell. Nobody but Bridget ever said goodbye to me like that; all her beginnings and endings where I was concerned were unpredictable, and most of the dialogue in between was enigmatic, a foreign language to any outsider. But for my benefit she talked in her own private shorthand, and what farewell meant was that she wanted me to button up my overcoat and take good care of myself until ten in the morning, because she would miss me in a way that would take far too much sentimental effort to express. I knew what she meant. Often I missed her while we were in the same room together.<br><br>I contemplated the phone for some time. Never had I heard her so oddly gay and forthright; as a matter of fact, we hadn't discussed sex since adolescence. Her entire inner life was secretive and mysterious, and no one dared violate it. She sent out powerful "No Trespassing" signals and I had learned to honor them. It crossed my mind that my sister was drunk.<br>Still, the next morning&#x2014;a warm October day in 1960&#x2014;I stood outside her apartment door, nonplussed by the stack of mail and the furled <i>New York Times</i> propped against it. The door itself was slowly getting on my nerves. It didn't open when I rang the doorbell for the fifth or sixth time. It didn't have a crack underneath big enough for a worthwhile view of the interior, although idiotically I'd got down on my hands and knees and looked anyway. Nor did I have a key to unlock it. Even if she <i>had</i> been drunk the night before, which was unlikely&#x2014;besides, I prided myself on being able to interpret at least her external behavior&#x2014;she would have been incapable of losing track of her invitation; she was a creature of infuriating compulsion, particularly in matters of time and place, always fussing about my lack of regard for either. Ever since she'd moved from her one-room, third-floor apartment (to which I had possessed a key, much used) to the comparative luxury of an apartment one floor higher with an actual separate bedroom and view (of the building across the street), I'd felt vaguely displaced and surly. For the last year, I'd though of that little one-room apartment as mine, an irrational attachment, since I was not exactly homeless. Until a month before, I'd been living not only in a commodious house in Greenwich, Connecticut, but also, during the week, in a <i>pied-�-terre</i> on East Seventy-second Street. My marriage to Michael Thomas, art historian and budding investment banker, so blithely undertaken during undergraduate days at Vassar and Yale, had, when removed from the insular academic atmosphere of New Haven, fallen apart. We were no longer wrapped in cotton wool; I was no longer a child bride. Now that our divorce was final, I'd moved our two small children into New York and into my own spacious apartment on Central Park West. I continued, however, to drop by Bridget's whenever I had five minutes between modeling jobs and interviews. "Just checking out my make-up," I'd announce breezily, or, "Gotta use your phone." The idea of telling my sister I'd really come to see her would never have crossed my mind.<br><br>Her new quarters did have certain advantages: twice the closet space for her warehouses of clothes and shoes, and a fully mirrored bathroom, very handy for looking at oneself from all angles while sitting on the cosmetics-crammed counter and conversing with Bridget submerged in the tub as she tested some new bubble bath. But I had never acquired the same proprietary feelings about this setup. It just didn't have the smell and cozy inconvenience of the old. And now I cursed myself for neglecting to collect the duplicate key she'd had made for me weeks ago. Becoming more and more exasperated with both of us, I rang fiercely four times in a row. Actually I felt like kicking the door. Then I though I heard a sound from where the bedroom ought to be. Of course, it was possible that she might still be asleep. Or, more interesting, asleep with an as yet undisclosed lover. But wouldn't she have left a characteristically humorous note to that effect, right where the bills from Con Ed and Jax were now lying? I began to punch the doorbell to the rhythm of "Yankee Doodle Dandy." During countless afternoon naps when we were young, we'd invented out of boredom what we thought was this highly original game, whereby we would take turns tapping out an unidentified song with our fingernails on the wooden headboards of our twin beds; the object was to determine who was better at guessing it or tapping it, or even choosing it if it was particularly esoteric. We both became fairly skillful, but this time the old signal got no response. I decided that the noise was either imagined or my stomach growling. Fresh orange juice and an English muffin with crisp bacon at Stark's around the corner on Lexington became increasingly crucial. I scribbled her a note and went on down in the elevator, trying to feel philosophical about the whole wasted half-hour. Clearly some matter of extreme urgency was to blame. At this very moment she was certainly racing back to meet me, caught between subways, maybe, wonder of wonders, even springing for a cab. <br><br>I galloped across the lobby toward the heavy glass doors and sunlight. Behind the streamlined reception desk, more appropriate to a luxury liner than an apartment building, was a ruddy-faced doorman.<br><br>"Hi. Did you see my sister go out today?"<br><br>"No, Miss," he answered in a thick brogue, "but then I only come on at eight."<br><br>"Ah." I hesitated with a charming smile. "Well. Tell me something." (I tried Mother's ingratiating imperative.) "Um, what time does the mail get delivered? I mean, to the people in the building?"<br><br>"Oh, Miss, maybe just over half an hour ago."<br><br>"And the newspaper?"<br><br>"Oh, somewhere around six or seven. Just a minute, Miss." He moved to the door to let in an elderly couple with a poodle and a Gristede's shopping bag, then bolted the door open so that all the sounds of the morning spewed in. A battle of simultaneous desires was shaping up; whether to go out or stay and satisfy my curiosity. After some consideration I followed him to the immense tropical plant at the entrance. It was embarrassing&#x2014;even melodramatic&#x2014;to ask for a key to apartment 403, but I did anyway.<br><br>"No problem, Miss. I'll ring Pete and ask him to take you up. He's in the basement."<br><br>"No, no, no, thanks, that's too much trouble." Ridiculous. For instance, what if she had had to meet Bill Francisco, a young director at the Yale Drama School (and romantic interest), for whom she was doing some kind of production work? She had probably left a message on my service. A telephone was clearly indicated. Again, Stark's. Besides, Bridget was so intensely ferocious about her privacy there was no telling what she'd do if she knew I'd go to such lengths to break into her sanctuary. Although Bridget was a year and a half younger, I was afraid of her. "Listen, do me a favor&#x2014;when you see her, tell her I came by and rang but there was no answer and I'll call her later. Okay?"<br><br>He nodded and started to lift his hand, but I was already out the door, feeling infinitely better, and striding toward Lexington.<br><br>By the time I'd downed my O.J., read the paper, checked Belles for a negative on messages, and gone to the ladies room, the grand superstructure of the day had begun to disintegrate. Out of perverseness, I jumped on the subway and went down to a sound stage on Fourth Street to watch the shooting of Kay Doubleday's big strip scene in <i>Mad Dog Coll</i>, a gangster film that can still, to my embarrassment, be seen occasionally on late-night TV. (It was the first movie I'd ever been in; I had many difficult thing to do, like play the violin and get raped by Vincent [Mad Dog] Coll, played by a young actor named John Chandler, who, on completion of the movie, decided to become a priest.) Kay Doubleday was in my class at Lee Strasberg's; it was in the interest of art, I told myself, to watch her prance down a ramp, singing and stripping her heart out. <br><br>I then ate a huge heavy lunch at Moscowitz &amp; Lupowitz with the art director Dick Sylbert. Over coffee, he smoked his pipe and patiently tried to explain the difference between champlev� and cloisonn� enamel. This meandered into a discussion of etching techniques. Having killed the afternoon to m thorough satisfaction, I took a slow but up Madison Avenue in order to read <i>Time </i>magazine. It was an absolutely beautiful four o'clock, the best in months, and when the bus got as afar as Fifty-fourth Street, I decided to disembark, fetch Bridget after first giving her hell, and buy a new pair of shoes. <br><br>About a block away from her building, a strange thing happened. I was seized by what seemed to be a virulent case of the flu. My temperature rose and fell five degrees in as many seconds. Hot underground springs of scalding perspiration seeped out everywhere, and yet I was shaking with cold, frostbitten inside and out. There was nothing reassuring about the pavement under my feet; I couldn't move forward on it. Well, I thought, by way of helpful explanation, I should be getting home anyway. Besides, after the screw-up this morning she owes me the next move; either this is repressed anger or pre-menstrual tension, but in any case how virtuous and rich I shall feel for not having bought a pair of shoes this afternoon.<br><br>I hailed a cab fast, so that I wouldn't have to waste time squatting on Fifty-fourth Street at rush hour with my head between my legs. Ah, well, I thought feverishly, "I grow old . . . I grow old . . . I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled," an ague hath my ham; marrow fatigue, not enough exercise, no tennis, badminton, swimming, fencing, volleyball, modern dance, <i>any </i>dance. I missed school gymnasiums, horseback riding; all I did now was tramp concrete sidewalks and wooden stages and Central Park on weekends. Middle age was phasing out into senility. I fooled the cabdriver, though, by smiling at him so he wouldn't notice all the change I dropped as we pulled up to 15 West Eighty-first Street, across from the Hayden Planetarium. Dark and cool, its dingy Moorish fountained-and-tiled lobby always welcomed me home from the wars. I rose in the elevator, gratefully trying to snuggle against its ancient varnished paneling, and finally stood with ossified feet in the small hall outside my door. The hall was semiprivate; unfortunately it provided wizened old Mrs. Rosenbaum and myself with a common meeting ground, ours being the only two apartments opening off it. She endowed it richly with a perpetual odor of cabbage, and I with an expensive new lay or wallpaper to distract from her barbaric cuisine.</p><h2>Goosebumps Monster Edition 3: The Ghost Next Door, Ghost Beach, and The Barking Ghost</h2><p>A monster edition of three classic Goosebumps tales comes complete with a wailing sound chip and the classic stories, The Ghost Next Door, Ghost Beach, and Barking Ghost.</p><p></p><h2>Darkness Is My Only Companion: A Christian Response to Mental Illness</h2><p>Where is God in the suffering of a mentally ill person? What happens to the soul when the mind is ill? How are Christians to respond in the face of mental illness? In <i>Darkness Is My Only Companion, </i>Kathryn Greene-McCreight confronts these difficult questions raised by her own mental illness--bi-polar disorder. <br><br>With brutal honesty, she tackles often avoided topics such as suicide, mental hospitals, and electroconvulsive therapy. Greene-McCreight offers the reader everything from poignant and raw glimpses into the mind of a mentally ill person to practical and forthright advice for their friends, family, and clergy. Her voice is a comfort to those who suffer from mental illness and an invaluable resource for those who love and support them.</p><p><b>Kathryn Greene-McCreight</b> (PhD, Yale University) is Priest Associate at The Episcopal Church at Yale. Her previous books include <i>Ad Litteram: How Augustine, Calvin, and Barth Read the Plain Sense of Genesis 1-3</i> and <i>Feminist Reconstructions of Christian Doctrine: A Narrative Analysis and Appraisal</i>. She also serves on the board of the Elm City Chapter of NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Illness) and on the Patient and Advisory Council of Yale Psychiatric Hospital.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Greene-McCreight fell into a deep depression that lasted on and off for several years. Five years later she was diagnosed as bipolar, "a disease that scuttles between depression and mania." With mental illness so severe that she was hospitalized five times, she nevertheless continued to work as an Episcopal priest and theologian, wrestling with questions that therapists rarely broach but that Christian sufferers can't help asking: If all of God's intentions for us are good, why do we suffer? What is the relationship between mental illness and sin? Is the "dark night of the soul" different from depression? Will God forgive suicide? By means of personal story, theological reflection and practical suggestions for caregivers, Greene-McCreight takes readers into her mind as she plunges from frantic ecstasy ("Gorgeous exotic turbulent swirls of snow. Magic. The world tingles. My brain sparkles, all things connect") to profound despair ("the absence&#x2014;so present you can feel it, taste it, sometimes even heaven forbid, see it and hear it&#x2014;of the good"). With firm but never facile faith, she offers hope to Christians with mental illness and understanding to those who live and work with them. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Impeccably composed and meticulously particular in its observation of everything" (Harpers &amp; Queen), it focuses on the friendship of two men: William Beckwith, a young gay aristocrat who leads a life of privilege and promiscuity, and the elderly Lord Nantwich, an old Africa hand, searching for someone to write his biography and inherit his traditions.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>ALAN HOLLINGHURST was born in 1954. He is the author of one of the most highly praised first novels to appear in the 1980s, <i>The Swimming-Pool Library</i>, and was selected as one of the Best of Young British Novelists 1993. His second novel, <i>The Folding Star</i>, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the 1994 Booker Prize. His novel<i> The Line of Beaut</i>y won the Booker Prize in 2004.On entering a London public lavatory in blithe pursuit of quick, anonymous sex, beautiful and roguish young aristocrat William Beckwith isconfronted instead with an ancient, doddering member of the British House of Lords who, after muttering an incoherent string of polite non sequiturs, promptly keels over at his feet in embarrassed but undeniable coronary arrest. After saving the old man's life, Will is invited to tea by the grateful and slightly senile Lord Nantwich, who, surprised by Will's impressive lineage and appalled at his state of idle unemployment, engages the young man to write the Nantwich life story. Thus begins the unusual relationship that forms the core of this funny, sad and beautifully written novel. The Swimming Pool Library weaves a rich and fascinating tapestry of Britain's gay subculture spanning pre-World War I through the sexually abandoned early '80s, stopping short at the doorstep of AIDS. Hollinghurst's prose is fresh, witty and wise, and his ever-surprising, sinuously unfurling story is told with insouciant grace and unabashed sexuality. BOMC and QPBC alternates.

All these houses were specially photographed, often for the first time. In the accompanying text, Francesca Premoli-Droulers brilliantly links together the close ties that bind the writers, their books, and their houses.</p><p>A house is doubly important to a writer--not only as a home for oneself, but often as a workplace in which to write quietly and undisturbed (a concept Virginia Woolf lobbied for in her famous book <i>A Room of One's Own</i>). <i>Writers' Houses</i> captures these intimate places in which some of the world's greatest writers spent their most creative hours.<p> Twenty renowned writers of the last century are profiled in the places they lived, including Ernest Hemingway, Alberto Moravia, Hermann Hesse, Mark Twain, and Virginia Woolf, among others. Some of these authors' houses form a part of the oeuvre in which they write--Ernest Hemingway's Key West home or William Faulkner's Mississippi mansion, for example. In fact, many of the authors in <i>Writers' Houses</i>, such as Isak Dinesen, Dylan Thomas, William Butler Yeats, and Vita Sackville-West, were influenced by their homes and surroundings to the extent that their reputations are inextricably linked to those places.</p><p> The large color photographs reveal the private places in which these authors lived and worked, surrounded by photos of loved ones, mementos of travels, and views of their gardens or the sea. Author Francesca Premoli-Droulers writes eloquently of the events that led to the purchase of each home, as well as the activities that took place there.</p><p> Many of the writers featured here led lives full of turbulence and upheaval at one time or another, and their homes marked one of the few places in which they found a place to write in solitude and comfort. <i>Writers' Houses</i> allows us access into these writers' private worlds, where some of their most famous creations came to life. <i>--Kris Law</i></p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Mots d&#39;Heures: Gousses, Rames: The d&#39;Antin Manuscript</h2><p>Nonsense poems in French, when pronounced, sound like English nursery rhymes, such as Humpty Dumpty and Jack Sprat.</p><p>Text: English, French</p><h2>Happy Ending and A Day of Absence.

We don&#x2019;t always read their stories with much awareness of the pressures they faced, the doubts they had, the assumptions they made, or the alternatives they have chosen.<br><br>The <i>Dancing in the Desert Devotional Bible</i> in the New Living Translation encourages readers to take an honest look at the people in the Bible. Chris Tiegreen, author of many popular devotionals for both men and women, has written 270 devotionals that explore the lives of people in the Bible and how they faced their own life&#x2019;s wilderness and found meaning, significance, and purpose with God. When we keep our gaze fixed on a story bigger than our own lives, we, too, can learn to dance in even the driest of our deserts.</p><p>Scripture begins with a rich tapestry of human personalities and their experiences with God. Throughout history and in our own lives, we return to these characters to see what it means to believe God, follow him, and participate in his plans. We learn about how to relate to an invisible God&#x2014;to live a life of faith, to be guided and directed by him, and to participate in his mission in this world.<br><br>Stories of scripture are often portrayed two-dimensionally, making people in the Bible seem familiar, flat, or predictable. Of course, we know they aren&#x2019;t. But we often read their stories as simple tales. We forget the pressures they faced and the doubts they had. Even though they are far removed from our lives in time and culture, the people of the Bible faced the same kinds of tensions we face: faith versus doubt, right versus wrong, good versus evil. Like us, these men and women wandered through the wildernesses of life in search of meaning, significance, and purpose. By faith, they were able to remember God and his purposes when the darkness closed in around them. In the end, these important individuals not only survived their deserts; they learned how to dance in them.</p><h2>The Case of the Lost Temper (Veggie Tales - Values to Grow By)</h2><p>The Case of the Lost Temper<br>A Lesson in SELF-CONTROL Who's guilty in the case of the lost temper?

But change is possible, and there are clear paths leading to it.<br> <br>This is why, ten years ago, we created a new treatment program, the Center for Motivation and Change (CMC), in New York City, where we are part of a revolution in addiction treatment based on evidence and on a new model for change.<br> <br>We built our practice on optimism, not because it made us feel good, though it does, but because it works. We base our optimism, our clinical practice, and now this book on forty years of well-documented research on how substances and other compulsive behaviors affect people, why people use them, and how and why people stop self-destructive behavior and start on paths toward health and happiness. In turn, our experiences with thousands of clients bear out the research findings.<br> <br>There is in fact a science of change.<br> <br>Every day at CMC we see clients put it into practice, using the knowledge, attitudes, and skills you&#x2019;ll find in this book. It takes time, and it is not usually a straight or smooth path. But it is a better way. Things can and do change. The process already started when you picked up this book.<br> The Science of Change<p></p> <br>It&#x2019;s been five hundred years since the scientific revolution, and we&#x2019;ve had modern medicine for at least a century. Yet shockingly, the understanding and treatment of substance use in the United States has been exempt from scientific standards and separate from mainstream healthcare until quite recently.<br> <br>Researchers in America only began to collect evidence in earnest in the 1970s. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) was established in 1970, followed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1974. Finally, after years of folk wisdom running the gamut from truly helpful to ineffective to harmful, federal money flowed toward scientific studies of what works, including what family and friends like you can do to help. The increasing number of controlled studies, including our own, over these forty-odd years, has created a mountain of evidence&#x2014;scientists have separated the wheat from the chaff, revealing that certain approaches and treatment strategies are more successful than others. That&#x2019;s good news, and we hope that it will help you find your own optimism.<br> <br>Most people equate treatment with intensive, residential &#x201c;rehab&#x201d; and believe rehab is the starting point of all change. In fact, there are many treatment options and substantial evidence that outpatient treatment is at least as effective in most cases and often a better place to start. Since 1996, the American Society of Addiction Medicine recommends starting with the least intensive treatment that is safe. Dr. Mark Willenbring, former director of the Treatment and Recovery Research Division of NIAAA, describes how the vast majority of people who could benefit from help don&#x2019;t get it, in part because the system is designed to treat the most severe problems, while the culture dictates waiting until someone &#x201c;hits bottom&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, waiting until problems become severe. Family members and friends are left with few options other than to stand by and watch things get worse, then get their loved one into rehab if they can. This despite strong evidence that reaching people early, when their problems are less severe and more treatable, leads to better outcomes. Thankfully, the treatment system is starting to change.<br> <br>The evidence supports many ways to address substance use disorders, as many ways as there are reasons people have them. Treatment is not always necessary; it turns out that many people get better without ever seeking professional help. There is also clear evidence that certain treatment approaches consistently outperform others. Cognitive-behavioral and motivational approaches, for example, which treat substance abuse like any other human behavior, are significantly more effective than confrontational approaches aimed to challenge a person&#x2019;s &#x201c;denial&#x201d; about his &#x201c;disease.&#x201d;<br> <br>Research has demonstrated that the popular belief that if someone &#x201c;just stops&#x201d; using a substance, then the rest of his problems will take care of themselves is simplistic and untrue. Substance problems are complex and multidetermined, often driven by underlying psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or attention deficit disorders that require specialized attention over and beyond just treating the substance problem. In other words, good treatment often includes psychiatric care, which has historically been overlooked or even discouraged in some drug and alcohol treatment settings.<br> <br>Science has also given us a better understanding of the brain&#x2019;s role in substance use and compulsive behaviors. With that science, there are new medications that reduce cravings and compulsivity, block drug effects, ease withdrawal, and treat underlying issues. Neuroimaging research provides new insights into the effects of substances on the brain; and recent discoveries in neuroscience have shown the power of neuroplasticity in the brain&#x2019;s healing itself.<br> <br>And science has revealed that teenagers are not simply grown-ups who text a lot; they are neurologically, psychologically, socially, and legally different from adults, and they have different treatment needs. Until about fifteen years ago, most of the services available for adolescents were barely modified adult treatments. Clinical trials have shown us that teenagers respond well to appropriate treatment and just as with adults, some treatments are considerably more effective than others. You might be surprised to learn that they all involve parents as active treatment participants (and often siblings, peers, and school systems).II<br> <br>Finally, research has shown how you can play a role in change. Our work with families and friends of people with substance problems is informed by CRAFT&#x2014;Community Reinforcement and Family Training&#x2014;a scientifically supported, evidence-based, clinically proven approach to helping families of substance abusers. CRAFT grew out of treatment innovations that began in the 1970s. A group of researchers in Illinois, led by behavioral psychologist Nathan Azrin, developed what is still the most effective behavioral treatment for substance users, and called it the Community Reinforcement Approach, or CRA. In the process, they discovered that family involvement was a crucial factor in successful change. Robert J. Meyers, PhD (one of the original Illinois group), expanded the CRA approach to work with families when their loved one refused help, and called it CRAFT. After moving to the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse and Addictions (CASAA) at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Meyers conducted further research and clinical trials (teaming with Jane Ellen Smith, PhD), and they and others investigating CRAFT have given us robust evidence that given the right tools, families can effect change.<br> <br>CRAFT has three goals: 1.) to teach you skills to take care of yourself; 2.) to teach you skills you can use to help your loved one change; and 3.) to reduce substance use, period, whether your loved one gets formal treatment or not. CRAFT is behavioral in that it employs strategies for real-world, observable change. CRAFT is also motivational, drawing its strength from collaboration and kindness rather than confrontation and conflict. This motivational and behavioral approach is the core of our work with families, the substance of the helping strategies in this book, and an opportunity for profound change.<br> <br>Drs. Meyers and Smith and other research groups have studied CRAFT with family members from a variety of socioeconomic, ethnic, and age groups struggling with a range of different substances, with the following results:<br> <br>�&nbsp;Two-thirds of people using substances who had been initially resistant to treatment agreed to go to treatment (typically after family members had around five sessions of CRAFT).<br> <br>�&nbsp;The majority of participating spouses and parents reported being happier, less depressed, less angry, and having more family cohesion and less family conflict than prior to their CRAFT sessions, whether or not their loved one engaged in treatment.<br> <br>�&nbsp;CRAFT&#x2019;s effectiveness in engaging substance users and improving family functioning is found across substance types, relationship types, and ethnicities.<br><br>Good News: Things get better with CRAFT. Families feel better, substance use often decreases, and people with substance problems usually enter treatment when a family member uses CRAFT.<br><br>CRAFT works, first, because it understands substance problems holistically, in the context of family, community, and work. People do not use substances in a vacuum. Their relationships impact their substance use just as their substance use impacts their relationships. CRAFT recognizes that most family members and friends, for their part, have good intentions, good instincts, and a healthy desire to help. CRAFT treats the problems families face as a deficit of skills rather than as a disease of codependence. These skills can be learned.<br> <br>Second, CRAFT recognizes that &#x201c;just stopping&#x201d; is not a sustainable long-term solution. While change depends at first on stopping (or reducing), the $64,000 question is what promotes staying stopped. CRAFT asks you to see what makes substance use rewarding to your loved one, so that you can introduce the &#x201c;competition&#x201d;&#x2014;more constructive activities that serve the same needs&#x2014;into her world. To this end, CRAFT will feel strange at first. If you have been viewing her substance problem as the cause of all other problems for some time, you may wonder what taking her bike in for a tune-up could have to do with anything. Plenty, as we&#x2019;ll see.<br> What We Offer<p></p> <br>First, we offer a new perspective on why your loved one does what he does. &#x201c;Why&#x201d; is a key to change. Second, we will teach you skills: positive communication, reinforcement strategies, and problem-solving skills to transform your relationship with your loved one and your life. Third, we will help you navigate what is often a one-toned, ideologically tinged treatment system, because there are treatment approaches and settings, medications, and knowledge available that you run a high risk of never encountering through traditional channels. Fourth, we will show you how to take better care of yourself so you&#x2019;ll have the energy to keep going, keep changing, keep helping. Finally, we will teach you skills to make peace with the things you cannot change.<br> Questions You Might Have<p></p> <br>Here are the primary questions from families who come to us. While there is no quick fix, we do have some answers.<br> <br>Can I really help him if he doesn&#x2019;t want to change?<br> <br>Yes! This is perhaps the best question you could ask, and really the heart of the matter. With a motivational approach, part of helping people change is helping them want to change. You, the one at his side, worried, distraught, and horrified, don&#x2019;t have to stand by in detachment or go ballistic as your only alternatives (though you might do these things sometimes anyway). If you give people the right encouragement, stay connected to them, provide good options (not ultimatums), respect their right to be part of the solution, and keep your balance by taking care of yourself and setting healthy limits, things get better. Change doesn&#x2019;t always happen as quickly as we want and it can be messy, but it happens.<br> <br>Even when people say repeatedly that they don&#x2019;t want to or simply can&#x2019;t change, they do so all the time&#x2014;even in the face of long odds. Why? Because change becomes worth it to them. The balance shifts enough for them to say, &#x201c;Enough! Let me try another way.&#x201d; The pain of continuing what they are doing and the benefits of changing begin to seem to them to outweigh the benefits of continuing to use and the pain of changing. The little-known but well-documented secret of our field is that many people change on their own, including recovering from terrible substance problems, because change becomes worth it.<br> <br>The reality is that people by nature have a self-righting mechanism&#x2014;but you don&#x2019;t need to wait passively for this righting mechanism to kick in. Your involvement can help bring about an internal shift in your loved one toward positive change. Most people do not need to &#x201c;hit rock bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;admit they are addicts&#x201d; for real change to occur. Though some people change this way, it&#x2019;s not the only way. In fact, when people use these phrases to describe how they changed, they are expressing their versions of exactly what we mean&#x2014;something shifted to make it worth it to them. What you will learn here is how to help your loved one make this shift, without stepping away from him, and sooner rather than later. This book will help you trust and influence the process of change.<br> <br>What if I feel as though I&#x2019;ve already tried everything?<br> <br>Depending on what has transpired by the time you picked up this book, some skepticism at the idea of doing more is understandable. It&#x2019;s also natural for you to despair sometimes, but this doesn&#x2019;t mean your situation is actually hopeless. At some level you know this: you&#x2019;re reading this book because even if you feel as though you&#x2019;ve tried everything, you&#x2019;re still trying! It can be hard to feel hopeful when change doesn&#x2019;t seem to be happening, despite best intentions and major investments of time, money, and emotions. However, we know that you haven&#x2019;t tried everything, though you may feel like you have. How do we know? Because at this point only a few treatment providers in North America share our approach for working with families and friends. The system is starting to change, but for now we can be pretty sure you&#x2019;ll find something new here.<br> <br>You&#x2019;l...</p><h2>Bodies of Modernity: Figure and Flesh in Fin-de-Siecle France (Interplay)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Bodies of Modernity</em> explores the ways in which men's and women's bodies are represented in late nineteenth-century France.</strong></p> Thought to be unequivocally different from one another, modern men and women were expected to express their sexuality and social positions in the clothes they wore, the poses they struck, and the behavior they exhibited. In a series of case studies, <em>Bodies of Modernity</em> looks at works by Cezanne, Renoir, Seurat, Tissot, and Caillebotte as well as photographs of male body builders to establish an image of the modern body. Well-known works such as Renoir's <em>Nude in the Sunlight</em>, Seurat's <em>Young Woman Powdering Herself</em>, and Cezanne's <em>Large Bathers</em> are given new interpretations, while lesser known paintings like Tissot's series on <em>The Women of Paris</em> or Caillebotte's iconoclastic <em>Man at the Bath</em> are looked at seriously for the first time.<br><br><em>Bodies of Modernity</em> is an original account of one of the best-loved periods in Western art history. By taking "figure and flesh" as its focus, it bypasses traditional art historical categories and style labels to provide a reading of the work of the Impressionists and their contemporaries that gets to the heart of French society of the period.</p><p>Tamar Garb is Reader in the History of Art at University College London and author of Sisters of the Brush and Bodies of Modernity, among many publications on late nineteenth-century art and culture.paper 0-500-28049-5 Insofar as art historical inquiry in the second half of the 20th century increasingly has come to rely on psychological methodologies of one form or another, it has perhaps been more receptive than other academic fields to the advent of cultural studies; this adaptability is on ample display in Bodies of Modernity. In this bracing series of related essays, Garb (The Jew in the Text, not reviewed, etc.) examines t.he representation of gender in the works of late-19th-century French artists: Gustave Caillebotte, James Tissot, Georges Seurat, Auguste Renoir, and Paul Czanneand photographers, including a fascinating study of the larger cultural response to the bodybuilding movement pioneered by Edmond Desbonnet. Garb is particularly good in dissecting the societal imperatives that struck down such works as Caillebotte's seemingly innocuous Interior, Woman Reading (1880) and illuminating the subdued radicalism implicit in his paintings of urban artisans at work, as is her analysis of the trope of the female bather from Boucher and Fragonard through Renoir. There is, nonetheless, an occasional bit of mindlessness, as when Garb notes at one moment that Renoir, in his Nude in the Sunlight, is merely rendering a familiarread clichdartistic trope, but states thereafter that the work indicates that the artist obviously yearned for the ``fecund, free femininity'' the painting purportedly represents: No one can have it both ways, a scholar least of all. Such lapses are few, however, and well outnumbered by the sort of acute pronouncementNature was always the product of culture,'' from the same chapter, is onethat jars as much for the manner in which it distills a truth as for the economy with which it is presented. While neither her subject nor her approach is strikingly new, Garb's gaze is formidable, attenuated to precisely those nuances upon which a proper understanding of these works would seem to depend. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her old-fashioned, somewhat dark story, narrated "Dear Reader"-style, begins "within the walls of a castle, with the birth of a mouse." Despereaux Tilling, the new baby mouse, is different from all other mice. Sadly, the romantic, unmouselike spirit that leads the unusually tiny, large-eared mouse to the foot of the human king and the beautiful Princess Pea ultimately causes him to be banished by his own father to the foul, rat-filled dungeon.<p> The first book of four tells Despereaux's sad story, where he falls deeply in love with Princess Pea and meets his cruel fate. The second book introduces another creature who differs from his peers--Chiaroscuro, a rat who instead of loving the darkness of his home in the dungeon, loves the light so much he ends up in the castle&amp; in the queen's soup. The third book describes young Miggery Sow, a girl who has been "clouted" so many times that she has cauliflower ears. Still, all the slow-witted, hard-of-hearing Mig dreams of is wearing the crown of Princess Pea. The fourth book returns to the dungeon-bound Despereaux and connects the lives of mouse, rat, girl, and princess in a dramatic denouement.</p><p> Children whose hopes and dreams burn secretly within their hearts will relate to this cast of outsiders who desire what is said to be out of their reach and dare to break "never-to-be-broken rules of conduct."

It was a Saturday, the first week of August, and after helping his father sucker tobacco all morning he'd had the rest of the day for himself. He'd changed into his fishing clothes and driven three miles of dirt road to the French Broad. Travis drove fast, the rod and reel clattering in the truck bed, red dust rising in his wake. The Marlin .22 slid on its makeshift gun rack with each hard curve. He had the windows down, and if the radio worked he would have had it blasting. The truck was a '66 Ford, battered from a dozen years of farm use. Travis had paid a neighbor five hundred dollars for it three months earlier.&nbsp;He parked by the bridge and walked upriver toward where Caney Creek entered. Afternoon light slanted over Divide Mountain and tinged the water the deep gold of curing tobacco. A fish leaped in the shallows, but Travis's spinning rod was broken down and even if it hadn't been he wouldn't have bothered to cast. Nothing swam in the French Broad he could sell, only hatchery-bred rainbows and browns, some smallmouth, and catfish. The old men who fished the river stayed in one place for hours, motionless as the stumps and rocks they sat on. Travis liked to keep moving, and he fished where even the younger fishermen wouldn't go.&nbsp;In forty minutes he was half a mile up Caney Creek, the rod still in two pieces. There were trout in this lower section, browns and rainbows that had worked their way up from the river, but Old Man Jenkins would not buy them. The gorge narrowed to a thirty-foot wall of water and rock, below it the creek's deepest pool. This was the place where everyone else turned back, but Travis waded through waist-high water to reach the waterfall's right side. Then he began climbing, the rod clasped in his left palm as his fingers used juts and fissures for leverage and resting places.&nbsp;When he got to the top he fitted the rod sections together and threaded monofilament through the guides. He was about to tie on the silver Panther Martin spinner when a tapping began above him. Travis spotted the yellowhammer thirty feet up in the hickory and immediately wished he had his .22 with him. He scanned the woods for a dead tree or old fence post where the bird's nest might be. A flytier in Marshall paid two dollars if you brought him a yellowhammer or wood duck, a nickel for a single good feather, and Travis needed every dollar and nickel he could get if he was going to get his truck insurance paid this month.&nbsp;The only fish this far up were what fishing books and magazines called brook trout, though Travis had never heard Old Man Jenkins or anyone else call them a name other than speckled trout. Jenkins swore they tasted better than any brown or rainbow and paid Travis fifty cents apiece no matter how small. Old Man Jenkins ate them head and all, like sardines.&nbsp;Mountain laurel slapped his face and arms, and he scraped his hands and elbows climbing rocks there was no other way around. Water was the only path now. Travis thought of his daddy back at the farmhouse and smiled. The old man had told him never to fish places like this alone, because a broken leg or rattlesnake bite could get a body graveyard dead before someone found you. That was about the only kind of talk he'd ever heard from the old man, Travis thought as he tested his knot, always being put down about something--how fast he drove, who he hung out with. Nothing but a bother from the day he was born. Puny and sickly as a baby and nothing but trouble since. That's what his father had said to his junior high principal, like it was Travis's fault he wasn't stout as his daddy, and like the old man hadn't raised all sorts of hell when he himself was young.&nbsp;The only places with enough water to hold fish were the pools, some no bigger than a washtub. Travis flicked the spinner into the front of each pool and reeled soon as it hit the surface, the spinner moving through the water like a slow bright bullet. In every third or fourth pool a small orange-finned trout came flopping onto the bank, treble hook snagged in its mouth. Travis slapped the speckleds' heads against a rock and felt the fish shudder in his hand and die. If he missed a strike, he cast again into the same pool. Unlike brown and rainbows, speckleds would hit twice, sometimes even three times. Old Man Jenkins had said when he was a boy most every stream in Madison County was thick as gnats with speckleds, but they'd been too easy caught and soon fished out, which was why now you had to go to the back of beyond to find them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eight trout weighted the back of his fishing vest when Travis passed the no trespassing sign nailed aslant a pin oak tree. The sign was as scabbed with rust as the decade-old car tag nailed on his family's barn, and he paid it no more heed now than when he'd first seen it a month ago. He knew he was on Toomey land, and he knew the stories. How Carlton Toomey once used his thumb to gouge a man's eye out in a bar fight and another time opened a man's face from ear to mouth with a broken beer bottle. Stories about events Travis's daddy had witnessed before he'd got right with the Lord. But Travis had heard other things. About how Carlton Toomey and his son were too lazy and hard-drinking to hold steady jobs. Travis's daddy claimed the Toomeys poached bears on national forest land. They cut off the paws and gutted out the gallbladders because folks in China paid good money to make potions from them. The Toomeys left the meat to rot, too sorry even to cut a few hams off the bears' flanks. Anybody that trifling wouldn't bother walking the hundred yards between farmhouse and creek to watch for trespassers.&nbsp;Travis waded on upstream, going farther than he'd ever been before. He caught more speckleds, and soon seven dollars' worth bulged the back of his fishing vest. Enough money for gas and to help pay his insurance, and though it wasn't near the money he'd been making at Pay-Lo bagging groceries, at least he could do this alone, not fussed at by some old hag of a store manager with nothing better to do than watch his every move, then fire him just because he was late a few times.&nbsp;He came to where the creek forked and it was there he saw a sudden high greening a few yards above him on the left. He stepped from the water and climbed the bank to make sure it was what he thought. The plants were staked like tomatoes and set in rows like tobacco or corn. They were worth money, a lot of money, because Travis knew how much his friend Shank paid for an ounce of good pot and this wasn't ounces but pounds.&nbsp;He heard something behind him and turned, ready to drop the rod and reel and make a run for it. On the other side of the creek a gray squirrel scrambled up the thick bark of a blackjack oak. Travis told himself there was no reason to get all feather-legged, that nobody would have seen him coming up the creek.&nbsp;He let his eyes scan what lay beyond the plants. A woodshed concealed the marijuana from anyone at the farmhouse or the dirt drive that petered out at the porch steps. Animal hides stalled mid-climb on the shed's graying boards. Coon and fox, in the center a bear, their limbs spread as though even in death they were still trying to escape. Nailed up there like a warning, Travis thought.&nbsp;He looked past the shed and didn't see anything moving, not even a cow or chicken. Nothing but some open ground and then a stand of tulip poplar. He rubbed a pot leaf between his finger and thumb, and it felt like money, a lot more money than he'd ever make at a grocery store. He looked around one more time before taking out his pocketknife and cutting down five plants. The stalks had a twiney toughness like rope.&nbsp;That was the easy part. Dragging them a mile down the creek was a chore, especially while trying to keep the leaves and buds from being stripped off. When he got to the river he hid the marijuana in the underbrush and walked the trail to make sure no one was fishing. Then he carried the plants to the road edge, stashed them in the gully, and got the truck.&nbsp;When the last plants lay in the truck bed, he wiped his face with his hand. Blood and sweat wet his palm. Travis looked in the side mirror and saw a thin red line where mountain laurel had slapped his cheek. The cut made him look tougher, more dangerous, and he wished it had slashed him deeper, enough to leave a scar. He dumped his catch into the ditch, the trout stiff and glaze-eyed. He wouldn't be delivering Old Man Jenkins any speckleds this evening.&nbsp;Travis drove home with the plants hidden under willow branches and feed sacks. He planned to stay only long enough to get a shower and put on clean clothes, but as he was about to leave his father stopped him.&nbsp;"We haven't ate yet."&nbsp;"I'll get something in town," Travis replied.&nbsp;"No. Your momma's fixing supper right now, and she's got the table set for three."&nbsp;"I ain't got time. Shank's expecting me."&nbsp;"You'll make time, boy," his father said. "Else you and that truck can stay in for the evening."&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was six-thirty before travis turned into the abandoned Gulf station and parked window to window beside Shank's Plymouth Wildebeast.&nbsp;"You won't believe what I got in the back of this truck."&nbsp;Shank grinned.&nbsp;"It's not the old prune-faced bitch that fired you, is it?"&nbsp;"No, this here is worth something. Get out and I'll show you."&nbsp;They walked around to the truck bed and Shank peered in.&nbsp;"I didn't know there to be a big market for willow branches and feed sacks."&nbsp;Travis looked around to see if anyone was watching, then pulled back enough of a sack so Travis could see some leaves.&nbsp;"I got five of them," Travis said.&nbsp;"Holy shit. Where'd that come from?"&nbsp;"Found it when I was fishing."&nbsp;Travis pulled the sack back over the plant.&nbsp;"Reckon I better start doing my fishing with you," Shank said. "It's for sure I been going to the wrong places." Shank leaned against the tailgate. "What are you going to do with it? I know you ain't about to smoke it yourself."&nbsp;"Sell it, if I can figure out who'll buy it."&nbsp;"I bet Leonard Shuler would," Shank said. "Probably give you good money for it too."&nbsp;"He don't know me though. I'm not one of his potheads like you."&nbsp;"Well, we'll just have to go and get you all introduced," Shank said. "Let me lock my car and me and you will go pay him a visit."&nbsp;"How about we go over to Dink Shackleford's first and get some beer."&nbsp;"Leonard's got beer," Shank said, "and his ain't piss-warm like what we got last time at Dink's."&nbsp;They drove out of Marshall, following 25 North. A pink, dreamy glow tinged the air. Rose-light evenings, Travis's mother had called them. The carburetor coughed and gasped as the pickup struggled up High Rock Ridge. Travis figured soon enough he'd have money for a carburetor kit, maybe even get the whole damn engine rebuilt.&nbsp;"You're in for a treat, meeting Leonard," Shank said. "There's not another like him, leastways in this county."&nbsp;"Wasn't he a teacher somewhere up north?"&nbsp;"Yeah, but they kicked his ass out."&nbsp;"What for," Travis asked, "taking money during homeroom for dope instead of lunch?"&nbsp;Shank laughed.&nbsp;"I wouldn't put it past him, but the way I heard it he shot some fellow."&nbsp;"Kill him?"&nbsp;"No, but he wasn't trying to. If he had that man would have been dead before he hit the ground."&nbsp;"I heard tell he's a good shot."&nbsp;"He's way beyond good," Shank said. "He can hit a chigger's ass with that pistol of his."&nbsp;After a mile they turned off the blacktop and onto a dirt road. On both sides what had once been pasture sprouted with scrub pine and broom sedge. They passed a deserted farmhouse, and the road withered to no better than a logger's skid trail. Trees thickened, a few silver-trunked river birch like slats of caught light among the darker hardwoods. The land made a deep seesaw and the woods opened into a small meadow, at the center a battered green and white trailer, its back windows painted black. Parked beside the trailer was a Buick LeSabre, front fender crumpled, rusty tailpipe held in place with a clothes hanger. Two large big-shouldered dogs scrambled out from under the trailer, barking furiously, brindle hair hackled behind their necks.&nbsp;"Those damn dogs are Plott hounds," Travis said, rolling his window up higher.&nbsp;Shank laughed.&nbsp;"They're all bark and bristle," Shank said. "Them two wouldn't fight a tomcat, much less a bear."&nbsp;The trailer door opened and a man wearing nothing but a frayed pair of khaki shorts stepped out, his brown eyes blinking like some creature unused to light. He yelled at the dogs and they slunk back under the trailer.&nbsp;The man was no taller than Travis. Blond, stringy hair touched his shoulders, something not quite a beard and not quite stubble on his face. Older than Travis had figured, at least in his mid-thirties. But it was more than the creases in the brow that told Travis this. It was the way the man's shoulders drooped and arms hung--like taut, invisible ropes were attached to both his wrists and pulling toward the ground.&nbsp;"That's Leonard?"&nbsp;"Yeah," Shank said. "The one and only."&nbsp;"He don't look like much."&nbsp;"Well, he'll fool you that way. There's a lot more to him than you'd think. Like I said, you ought to see that son-of-a-bitch shoot a gun. He shot both that yankee's shoulders in the exact same place. They say you could of put a level on those two holes and the bubble would of stayed plumb."&nbsp;"That sounds like a crock of shit to me," Travis said. He lit a cigarette, felt the warm smoke fill his lungs. Smoking cigarettes was the one thing his old man didn't nag him about. Afraid it would cut into his sales profits, Travis figured.&nbsp;"If you'd seen him shooting at the fair last year you'd not think so," Shank said.&nbsp;Leonard walked over to Travis's window, but he spoke to Shank.&nbsp;"Who's this you got with you?"&nbsp;"Travis Shelton."&nbsp;"Shelton," Leonard said, pronouncing the name slowly as he looked at Travis. "You from the Laurel?"&nbsp;Leonard's eyes were a deep gray, the same color as the birds old folks called mountain witch doves. Travis had once heard the best marksmen most always had gray eyes and wondered why that might be so.&nbsp;"No," Travis said. "But my daddy grew up there."&nbsp;Leonard nodded in a manner that seemed to say he'd figured as much. He stared at Travis a few moments before speaking, as though he'd seen Travis befo...</p><h2>Listening Prayer: Learning to Hear God&#39;s Voice and Keep a Prayer Journal</h2><p>True listening is obedient listening.

Your beautiful, brainy daughter is anorexic, or addicted to drugs, or unwilling to leave the man who hits her. Increasing numbers of baby boomers are finding that their grown children have fallen far short of their expectations. These parents are confused, angry, guilt-ridden, and ashamed. Jane Adams&#x2019;s <i>When Our Grown Kids Disappoint Us</i> is for them. She reveals the kinds of disappointments that other parents are facing: kids who are unable or unwilling to support themselves, kids who are addicts or convicts, kids who&#x2019;ve joined cults or seemingly dropped off the face of the earth. She stresses that these are real problems--but that they aren&#x2019;t the parents&#x2019; problems. Adams reassures parents that they&#x2019;ve done their jobs and that they don&#x2019;t have to spend the rest of their lives picking up the pieces for their grown children, emotionally, financially, or otherwise. Continuing to prop up kids who&#x2019;ve repeatedly fallen on their own teaches them nothing; it&#x2019;s just a temporary fix. Beyond offering sympathy, reassurance, and wisdom, the book doesn&#x2019;t lay out a plan for solving anyone&#x2019;s problems, but reading it may help disappointed parents shuck some of their guilt and shame, gather the courage to take back their own lives, and let their grown children fend for themselves. <i>--Jennifer Lindsay</i><b>Jane Adams, Ph.D.,</b> has been chronicling the lives of American families for over two decades in ten books and numerous columns, articles, and essays.

He traces the crucial contributions made by the Indians to our federal system of government, our democratic institutions, modern medicine, agriculture, architecture, and ecology, and in this astonishing, ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward recovering a true American history.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>JACK WEATHERFORD holds the DeWitt Wallace Chair of Anthropology at Macalester College in Minnesota and an honorary position at Chinggis Khaan University in Mongolia. In 2007 he received the Order of the Polar Star, the highest award for service to the Mongol Nation of Genghis Khan.YA-- Beginning with a clever title and continuing throughout the book, Weatherford lists the tremendous contributions which have been made by the Indian civilizations of the Americas to world culture. He shows the impact of gold and silver, agricultural techniques, medicine, and government on European history. The book makes for fascinating, thought-provoking reading, showing that Locke and Rousseau were both influenced by the concepts of power and government held by the people of the Americas before they produced their great documents of the Enlightment. Weatherford also shows how the spread of the potato to Europe saved many lives from the malnutrition which had haunted them when grain crops had previously failed. He has a far-reaching scope and even suggests a fascinating theory on the purpose of Machu Picchu. By showing how the world was changed through these contributions, the author gives a greater appreciation of the Indians of America to readers.

You won&#39;t need a soldering iron, or any expensive tools either, as this is just about wrapping, coiling and twisting wire. I say &#34;just&#34; but taking a look at the cover was what convinced me that this was one book I just had to own. There are some truly stunning pieces in here, and all made predominantly with something as ordinary as wire! As the author of the introduction says, this is not a beginner&#39;s book, but as she goes on to point out, neither is it an advanced one. It is a book that sets out to tell you all about the different types of jewelry wire and what they can do for you, and then what you can make. Each project concentrates on a different aspect of wirework, so you can learn while you fill up your jewelry box. In my opinion, this is always a good way to learn rather than just by making practice pieces, especially when you are working with materials which do not come cheap. There are some staged photographs to show how it is done, and if you follow the instructions and work carefully you ought to be the proud possessor of some items that look as if they have come from a high-end jewelry store. At the back is a short gallery of pieces done both by students and by the author, and a list of addresses and magazines for US readers.

In the previous episode of the Paths of Darkness series (of the Forgotten Realms umbrella series), Wulfgar the barbarian fought a demon, was possessed and supposedly killed. Now it turns out that not only is he alive but he is in need of the type of assistance at which his friends excel. Getting to Wulfgar and aiding him in his quest for Aegis-fang, his warhammer, is only part of the fun. Drizzt Do'Urden, along with Cattie-Brie, a dwarf named Bruenor Battlehammer and Regis the Halfling, often have to battle the obligatory orcs, goblins and ogres on their way to the real business at hand. A second plot involves the stalking of Drizzt Do'Urden by Le'Lorinel, a Moon elf (or pale elf, whereas Drizzt is a Drow or dark elf). The author combines some of the good versus evil of Robin Hood and his merry men, the campy heroics and friendship of The Princess Bride (including an appearance of dread pirate Sheila Kree) and a rather unfulfilled stab at race relations with Le'Lorinel's unhinged hatred for Drizzt Do'Urden. As this is the fourth novel in the subseries of a larger series, it is not for the uninitiated. Long-awaited by Salvatore's legions of fans, however, this book is as certain as its predecessors to climb bestseller charts. 10-city author tour. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Bed of Roses Book Two in the Bride Quartet (Large Print)</h2><p>An incurable romantic, Emma Grant has the perfect job as wedding florist at Vows, the company she runs with her three best friends.

Practical and interactive, it focuses on the poses themselves, providing clear, concise instructions and detailed illustrations for each, all in a lay-flat format that's easy to refer to during yoga practice. It also includes six classic moving meditations (such as Sun Salutation and Camel Vinyasa), 10 beginner-to-advanced sessions, and 48 mini-sequences designed to build strength for specific activities or alleviate health problems. <i>Essential Yoga</i> combines physical poses (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayamas), and meditations (dhyanas) into a simple and complete reference guide for yoga practitioners of all levels. Along the way, author Olivia Miller provides guidance on proper technique and alignment; modifications for beginners or those with knee, neck, or back pain; suggestions for preventing injury; and ways to keep a regular practice interesting and active. For beginners as much as experts looking for one complete book that has it all, <i>Essential Yoga</i> is it.</p><p>Olivia H. Miller is a freelance writer and has been a student of yoga for twenty-five years. She lives on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.<br><br>Nicole Kaufman is a freelance illustrator whose work has appeared in several publications and books. She lives with her family in Sonoma County's beautiful wine country.One of the simplest yet most comprehensive yoga books to be published in recent memory, Miller's work could become a classic. Using elegant, gentle prose and graceful line drawings to illustrate poses, the book serves as an excellent introduction for those unfamiliar with or just getting used to breathing in downward facing dog position. Miller, who has been practicing yoga for over 25 years and [has written] for Yoga Journal and other publications, takes a three-pronged approach to teaching yoga, focusing on the equally important components of breathing, poses and meditation. She doesn't spend much time on the history and origins of yoga, and quickly moves to technique. Focusing on hatha yoga, Miller teaches readers breathing exercises and how to warm up, and then proceeds to standing, seated, prone, supine and inverted poses. Subsequent chapters share suggested meditations and suggested flow series. The latter section lays out routines practitioners can follow (among them, the popular sun salutation and camel vinyasa), as well as series of poses that Miller devised [with yoga teacher Paul Howard] that target specific conditions (including ones for anxiety and tension relief, cold prevention and improving circulation) and sports (e.g., running, swimming, tennis and rowing). By giving variations for each pose, Miller makes her book appropriate for all levels, although the positive and upbeat tone will especially comfort beginners struggling with the challenging pigeon or full shoulder-stand positions. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures. Nearly a century later, Kakuzo&#39;s The Book of Tea is still beloved the world over. In this edition, readers are treated to Kakuzo&#39;s delicious wisdom along with evocative quadratone photographs in an exquisite new package. Interwoven with a rich history of tea and its place in Japanese society is poignant commentary on Eastern culture and our ongoing fascination with it, as well as illuminating essays on art, spirituality, poetry, and more. The Book of Tea is a delightful cup of enlightenment from a man far ahead of his time.</p><p>That a nation should construct one of its most resonant national ceremonies round a cup of tea will surely strike a chord of sympathy with at least some readers of this review. To many foreigners, nothing is so quintessentially Japanese as the tea ceremony--more properly, "the way of tea"--with its austerity, its extravagantly minimalist stylization, and its concentration of extreme subtleties of meaning into the simplest of actions. <i>The Book of Tea</i> is something of a curiosity: written in English by a Japanese scholar (and issued here in bilingual form), it was first published in 1906, in the wake of the naval victory over Russia with which Japan asserted its rapidly acquired status as a world-class military power. It was a peak moment of Westernization within Japan. Clearly, behind the publication was an agenda, or at least a mission to explain. Around its account of the ceremony, <i>The Book of Tea</i> folds an explication of the philosophy, first Taoist, later Zen Buddhist, that informs its oblique celebration of simplicity and directness--what Okakura calls, in a telling phrase, "moral geometry." And the ceremony itself? Its greatest practitioners have always been philosophers, but also artists, connoisseurs, collectors, gardeners, calligraphers, gourmets, flower arrangers. The greatest of them, Sen Rikyu, left a teasingly, maddeningly simple set of rules: <blockquote> Make a delicious bowl of tea; lay the charcoal so that it heats the water; arrange the flowers as they are in the field; in summer suggest coolness; in winter, warmth; do everything ahead of time; prepare for rain; and give those with whom you find yourself every consideration. </blockquote> A disciple remarked that this seemed elementary. Rikyu replied, "Then if you can host a tea gathering without deviating from any of the rules I have just stated, I will become your disciple." A Zen reply. Fascinating. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i>Okakura Kakuzo was born in the bustling seaport of Yokohama in 1862, only eight years after Commodore Perry's "Black Ships" pried open Japan's international trade gates. Christian missionaries taught him to speak English and sing Methodist hymns, while Buddhist monks schooled him in Confucianism and drinking green tea. Working alongside his teachers at Tokyo University, all imported from New England, Okakura helped save Japan's artistic traditions from being tossed aside in favor of modern Western aesthetics. <br> <br>By the turn of the twentieth century, Okakura had made his way to Boston, where he became the Director of the Asian Arts Department at the Museum of Fine Arts and the favorite companion of Back Bay society's grande dame,&nbsp; Isabella Stewart Gardner. Okakura found tea to be the perfect metaphor for interpreting the Japanese art spirit to a Boston culture thirsty for a counterpoint to America's headlong rush into materialism and wealth. The Book of Tea was first published in 1906 and has never been out of print. It is one of the most influential books ever written for those looking to infuse the tea spirit into their lives.</p><h2>Pieces of Her: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>COMING TO NETFLIX!</strong></p><p><strong>Mother.

Diagramming sentences gives many visual and logical learners an alternative way to learn grammar. Students who understand the finer points of English grammar will apply this knowledge to their writing. For many students, boring old grammar lessons become understandable and fun-even kids who are traditionally more "math minded" begin to enjoy English lessons.<br><br>Each lesson provides plenty of practice diagramming. After completing all the lessons, there is a review where students diagram sentences using all the grammar rules they have learned.<br><br> The grammar lessons in <em>Sentence Diagramming Level 2</em> are:<br><br> � Appositive Phrases<br> � Objective Complement<br> � Gerunds and Gerund Phrases<br> � Participles<br> � Participial Phrases<br> � Infinitive Used as Nouns<br> � Infinitive Phrases<br> � Noun Clauses<br> � Adjective Clauses<br> � Adverbial Clauses<br> � Comparisons<br> � Compound-Complex Sentences</p><p></p><h2>Rain on the Dead</h2><p><b>The past comes back to haunt Sean Dillon and his colleagues, as the<i> New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling master of suspense returns with a knife-edge story of terrorism, revenge, and a very old nemesis.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In the past few years, the killing and capture of many Al-Qaeda leaders has left the terrorist organization wounded&#x2014;but by no means dead. And they intend to prove it.<br><br>On a dark summer night, two Chechen mercenaries emerge from the waters off Nantucket to kill a high-value target, the former president of the United States, Jake Cazalet. Unfortunately for them, Cazalet has guests with him, including black ops specialist Sean Dillon and his colleague, Afghan war hero Captain Sara Gideon.<br><br>The Chechens do not survive the night, but Dillon is curious as to how they even got on the island. What he discovers sends a chill through his bones&#x2014;a name from very far back in Dillon&#x2019;s past. If <i>this </i>man is working with the terrorists now, the assassination attempt is only the beginning&#x2014;and the next time, the results might be much, much different.</p><p><b>Jack Higgins</b> lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.The island of Nantucket, Massachusetts&#x2014;high summer, the western end of the harbor crowded with boats, many tied up at the jetty. Among them was a scarlet-and-white sportfisherman named Dolphin. On the flying bridge, a gray-haired man sat at the wheel playing a clarinet, something plaintive and touching. He was around sixty, a white curling beard giving him the look of an old sailor.<p>The man who joined him from below, wearing swimming trunks, had dark tousled hair and the beard of some medieval bravo. He was fit and muscular, his smile pleasant enough, his only unusual feature two scars on his left chest which any doctor would have recognized as relics from old bullet wounds.</p><p>He spoke in Irish. &#x201c;Big night, Kelly!&#x201d;</p><p>The other answered in the same. &#x201c;You could say that. It&#x2019;ll be dark soon, Tod&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re going to grab that swim, it&#x2019;d better be now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will. Keep your eye out for that kid, Henry, from the harbormaster&#x2019;s office. He&#x2019;s bringing our passports and the credit card, so don&#x2019;t forget to speak like the Yank your passport says you are.&#x201d;</p><p>He slid down the ladder, vaulted over the rail, and swam away. Kelly heard a call from the dock.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Jackson, are you there?&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly descended the ladder. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s having a swim. I&#x2019;m his partner, Jeremy Hawkins.&#x201d;</p><p>Henry handed over the two passports. &#x201c;There you go, sir, Mr. Jackson&#x2019;s credit card is in the envelope and your mooring license covers you until Friday.&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly took the package. &#x201c;Thanks, son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great clarinet I just heard. Kind of sounds like Gershwin, though I don&#x2019;t recognize the tune.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Irish folk song called &#x2018;The Lark in the Clear Air.&#x2019; And you&#x2019;re right, I did put a bit of Gershwin in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think he would have been pleased, sir. Are you and your friend professional musicians?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was for a while and he does play decent piano, but on the whole, we found other things kept getting in the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that seems like a damn shame to me,&#x201d; Henry said, and walked away, calling at another boat.</p><p>Kelly turned and looked out over the harbor to see how Tod was getting on, and saw him swimming toward a round buoy floating on a chain. Many people were diving or jumping off the boats, some in wet suits, generally having a good time while the light still held.</p><p>For his part, Tod stroked the last couple of yards, then grabbed onto the chain, aware of the unmistakable sound of a helicopter descending somewhere in the distance.</p><p>He hung there, listening, and two young men erupted from the water, like black seals in their wet suits. They were like twins, darkly handsome, the same wildness apparent in their faces.</p><p>The nearest one grabbed the chain and laughed as his brother joined them. &#x201c;Mr. Jackson, I recognize you from your photo. We&#x2019;re the ones you came to meet. The Master sends his regards and hopes that success in our venture will make us your favorite Chechens. I&#x2019;m Yanni and this is Khalid.&#x201d;</p><p>He had no accent, which his brother explained in a rather mocking tone. &#x201c;Our parents were killed by barbaric Russian soldiers in the Chechen war. The wonderful American Red Cross saved us and our grandparents, and gave us a new life in good old New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where thanks to the public school system, we emerged as normal American teenagers,&#x201d; Yanni said.</p><p>&#x201c;Creating a problem for Westerners who expect Muslims to look and sound like Arabs,&#x201d; Khalid said.</p><p>&#x201c;So what can Muslims who look like Westerners do?&#x201d; Yanni added.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, serve Allah as undercover warriors in the great struggle,&#x201d; his brother said. &#x201c;And here we are. We&#x2019;ve already checked out the house of our target. It&#x2019;s just off the beach, surrounded by trees, no problem. An easy one, this.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod said, &#x201c;Except that every security camera on every property you passed walking along that beach probably has your faces now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll wear ski masks for the hit,&#x201d; Khalid said. &#x201c;Why should it matter as long as the target is dead? That&#x2019;s all that counts.&#x201d;</p><p>They were no longer smiling. Their faces were like death masks, their eyes pinpricks. They were obviously on drugs, which exasperated Tod, though there was no point in mentioning it now.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back to that boat.&#x201d; He indicated the Dolphin.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you there in forty-five minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t reply, simply turned and swam away, and so did he.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Hawkins was Tim Kelly, and Jackson, Tod Flynn, both of them Provisional IRA who had served sentences in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland for many killings. Released during the peace process, they had become mercenaries. The situations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and elsewhere offered highly paid security work and sometimes rather more than that, for Flynn had been a top enforcer with the IRA, and reputation was everything in the Death Trade. It brought the cautious phone calls, the offers of the big money that went with them, and the offer for this present job had been very big.</p><p>In the cabin belowdecks, he had a large whiskey, feeling strangely cold, and told Kelly about his meeting with the Chechens. Kelly said, &#x201c;I knew it was a mistake to get involved with sodding Muslims. What are we going to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much we can do, but I&#x2019;ll tell you this. I&#x2019;m putting a pistol in my pocket for when they come, just in case it gets nasty. You should, too,&#x201d; and he hurried away to his cabin.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>He showered and dressed, and as he did so, remembered the first time he&#x2019;d heard the Master&#x2019;s voice, filled with quiet authority, and a touch of English upper class.</p><p>&#x201c;Would that be Mr. Tod Flynn?&#x201d; the voice had asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just credited your bank account with a hundred thousand dollars. Check for yourself, and I&#x2019;ll be back in fifteen minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod frowned, but called his bank and received the happy news that the money had indeed been deposited from a Swiss bank in Geneva.</p><p>When the second call came, he said instantly, &#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People know me as the Master. That will do for the moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Al-Qaeda,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;Everyone in the business knows about you guys and the way you operate. Don&#x2019;t you have enough of your own people to call on? What do you want me for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m a great admirer. That finance man in Nigeria you took care of&#x2014;five hundred yards through an open window of a car doing seventy. Splendid work. I have a list. My favorite was the Russian paratroop general who glanced out of the turret of his tank for a moment during a street battle and you took him at five hundred yards.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four hundred,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;And it was snowing. So what do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a target, living quietly in a house on the island of Nantucket with a manservant. I&#x2019;m sending in a couple of Chechen boys to knock him off. All I need from you is to keep an eye on things and pick them up when they&#x2019;re done. You&#x2019;ll be waiting in a boat off the beach and they&#x2019;ll swim out to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m the getaway driver, is that it?&#x201d; Tod laughed harshly. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he done, this target?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No need for you to know. Let&#x2019;s just say he&#x2019;s an old enemy.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod nodded. &#x201c;And what would be in it for me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already got one hundred thousand. That&#x2019;s for you and your friend Kelly. I&#x2019;ll give you another hundred afterward and take care of your expenses.&#x201d;</p><p>As usual, greed won the day. &#x201c;Add another fifty thousand,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;Which rounds it to a quarter of a million, and I expect the full advance before we go.&#x201d;</p><p>The man who called himself the Master paused, then said, &#x201c;Agreed.&#x201d;</p><p>And Tod, some part of him already regretting it, said, &#x201c;Done. When do we meet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will never happen, my friend. You&#x2019;ll have to be content with my voice on the phone. I&#x2019;ll send you a coded mobile with the tickets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Tim Kelly was shocked when Tod told him about the call. &#x201c;Holy Mary, do we have to get involved with a bunch of Muslims like al-Qaeda?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll dance a jig when that money turns up in your bank account,&#x201d; Tod said. Later, he did wonder why the Master wanted him at all. The mystery man had made all the arrangements and the plan itself was simple enough. It was the height of tourist season, and the two assassins would be just another couple of people strolling along by night, carrying beach bags that would contain a couple of silenced Glocks, more than adequate to handle the situation. When they were done, they could just walk away from the scene of silent slaughter, which wouldn&#x2019;t be discovered until morning, long after they had swum out to sea, each with a phosphorescent signaling ball held in his palm to guide in the waiting Dolphin.</p><p>It seemed too simple, and Tod couldn&#x2019;t think why, still couldn&#x2019;t as he finished dressing now, and then he heard a disturbance above. He hurried through the cabin, went on deck, and found Kelly switching on all the lights against the hurrying dark. The Chechens were there.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Tod demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;These two bastards are cracked, if you ask me,&#x201d; Kelly said. &#x201c;They were sharing a bottle as they came along the jetty. That young guy from the harbormaster&#x2019;s office remonstrated with them as they were boarding.&#x201d; He pointed at Khalid. &#x201c;This one told him to fuck off.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod grabbed Khalid by the front of his shirt. &#x201c;Stupid bastard, are you crazy? That kind of trouble is the last thing we need.&#x201d;</p><p>Yanni reached in his beach bag and produced a silenced Glock. &#x201c;Touch my brother again and I&#x2019;ll kill you.&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly, standing behind them, drew a Walther, but Tod released Khalid, laughing harshly. &#x201c;Go on, do it. Kill both of us, why don&#x2019;t you? Then tell me who&#x2019;s going to wait off that beach to pick you up.&#x201d;</p><p>Yanni put the Glock away and smiled falsely. &#x201c;Hey, can&#x2019;t you take a joke, Mr. Jackson? Khalid was having a laugh. Like boxers going in the ring for a big fight. You get kind of nervous waiting for the action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I suggest you go, find the action, and get on with it, and we&#x2019;ll get on with our part of the job.&#x201d;</p><p>Yanni laughed out loud. &#x201c;You know something, you&#x2019;re a real funny man, Mr. Jackson. I like you, I really do . . .&#x201d;</p><p>He gave his brother a push and they scrambled up onto the jetty. Khalid took a bottle from his pocket, held it up, then tossed it into the harbor. &#x201c;Just kidding, Mr. Jackson,&#x201d; he said, and they walked away.</p><p>&#x201c;Total fruitcakes,&#x201d; Kelly said in disgust. &#x201c;Where the hell did this Master find them? Don&#x2019;t tell me he didn&#x2019;t know they had problems.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind that for now. We&#x2019;ve got half an hour to spare before we have to cast off and go round the coast to wait for them. I could do with coffee and a sandwich,&#x201d; Todd said.</p><p>He led the way below, and as they reached the kitchen area, the coded mobile phone the Master had given him trembled. He took it out and switched it to speaker. He turned to Kelly, touched a finger to his lips and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Flynn, I&#x2019;m afraid something&#x2019;s come up that affects our plans,&#x201d; the voice said.</p><p>&#x201c;And what would that be?&#x201d; Tod demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just heard from a source that the target is receiving guests tonight by helicopter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We heard one arriving somewhere in the island not long ago,&#x201d; Tod told him.</p><p>The Master&#x2019;s voice was unemotional. &#x201c;Probably the one delivering them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll get a shock when they find themselves invaded by two crazy Chechens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Chechens we need to worry about,&#x201d; the Master said. &#x201c;His guests are General Charles Ferguson, who commands the British Prime Minister&#x2019;s private hit squad, and he has two of his top people with him. A Captain Sara Gideon and one Sean Dillon, a notorious IRA gunman who now works for Ferguson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I know these people, everyone in the Death Trade does.&#x201d; Flynn was angry now. &#x201c;Why the hell would they be here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to tell you who our target is. It&#x2019;s the former president of the United States, Jake Cazalet.&#x201d;</p><p>Tod was shocked. &#x201c;You lousy bastard.&#x201d;</p><p>The Master continued. &#x201c;You must cancel the operation. I can&#x2019;t do it. Yanni and Khalid have no phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Tod said. &#x201c;You knew they were wild cards and too untrustworthy to handle your special phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must try and stop them. Surely there&#x2019;s still time?&#x201d;</p><p>Tod was so angry he switched off.</p><p>Kelly said, &#x201c;Christ, what a cock-up. Maybe we&#x2019;ll be lucky and catch them walking the beach to Cazalet&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, we won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Tod told him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want anything more to do with this. We&#x2019;ll cast off right now, sail overnight to Long Island, and leave the boat at Quogue. Then we&#x2019;ll head straight to the airport and find the first plane that&#x2019;ll take us back to Dublin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And not even try to pick the boys up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really think there&#x2019;ll be anyone to pick up? Sean Dillon is a bloody living legend of the IRA, as no one knows better than you, and this Sara Gideon lass has a Military Cross for killing Taliban. Not to mention Ferguson himself. No, those Chechens are dead meat. And frankly, I couldn&#x2019;t care less.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The house stood in trees behind a vast beach reaching out from town. The helicopter had landed some distance away, where Cazalet&#x2019;s Secret Service man, Dalton, waited in a Jeep. He went to greet Ferguson and his people, who walked to meet him.</p><p>Ferguson shook hands. &#x201c;Here I am again, Agent Dalton. Nice to see you.&#x201d; They waited as the helicopter drifted away.</p><p>Dalton said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be back in the morning.&#x201d; He eased Sara&#x2019;s bag from her hand and led the way to the Jeep.</p><p>&#x201c;President Cazalet&#x2019;s really pleased to be seeing you. Mrs. Boulder has left out a lovely supper in the conservatory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The President? Is that how you still address him?&#x201d; Sara asked.</p><p>Ferguson said, &#x201c;Technically, all former holders of the office retain the title for life, but I think it&#x2019;s a matter of individual choice. Cazalet says there can only be one Mr. President and asks that I call him Jake. I could never bring myself to do it, so I make do with &#x2018;sir.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then &#x2018;sir&#x2019; it will be for me also,&#x201d; Sara said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing Murchison again,&#x201d; Ferguson said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the dog of the house, Sara, a wonderful flat-coated retriever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who once saved the President&#x2019;s life, as I recall,&#x201d; Dillon said. &#x201c;Although there&#x2019;s no official documentation of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too bad he isn&#x2019;t here tonight,&#x201d; said Dalton. &#x201c;Mrs. Boulder has taken him home with her. She gets lonely since her husband died last year, and the President doesn&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned off the road at a point where high-wire fencing fronted the trees. He paused, waiting for a ten-foot gate to open slowly between stone pillars, and drove through, pine trees and lots of shrubbery crowding in from both sides. To the left, they could see a terraced conservatory and they continued, circling around to a formal garden that fronted the old Colonial-style house with steps leading up to a pillared entrance, the door standing open, light pouring out, and Jake Cazalet waiting to greet them.</p><p>&#x201c;Charles, my dear old friend,&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Marvelous to see you, marvelous to see all of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Then he rushed down the steps to greet them, arms outstretched.</p><p>After embraces, Ferguson said, &#x201c;Now, this was all most mysterious. It&#x2019;s always a pleasure to see you, sir, but why were we summoned?&#x201d;</p><p>Cazalet said, &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s nothing dire.

The intruder&#x2019;s lantern cast fantastic shadows. Hardie wore civilian clothes and crouched under the tent&#x2019;s slant. It took Meade a moment to recognize him.<br>&#x201c;What the devil?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to give you trouble,&#x201d; the colonel said.<br>Blades of alarm pierced weariness. Meade sat up sharply.<br>&#x201c;My conscience is clear,&#x201d; he declared.<br>Margaret had warned him to check his temper. Now Hooker had charged him with insubordination, with Halleck&#x2019;s acquiescence and bespectacled Hardie as henchman. He was being relieved of his command, arrested in the middle of a campaign. There would be a court-martial. Reputation&#x2019;s assassin sneaking into camp, this colonel from the adjutant general&#x2019;s office had come in the dark, in disguise. And he had always thought Hardie a decent fellow.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done&nbsp;... nothing dishonorable,&#x201d; Meade protested. &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; He yearned for coffee just off the fire, for the light of day, for a friend. &#x201c;My differences with General Hooker&nbsp;... have been matters of professional judgment, nothing more.&#x201d;<br>The colonel raised a hand to quiet him. The gesture struck Meade as insolent. Hardie grinned.<br>Black and devilish, flies looped around the lantern the colonel held. Settling the light on the camp desk, Hardie drew a pair of envelopes from a pocket.<br>&#x201c;General Meade, you are ordered to assume command of the Army of the Potomac. Effective immediately, sir. I&#x2019;m to accompany you to General Hooker&#x2019;s headquarters, to witness the transfer of authority.&#x201d;<br>Dumbfounded, Meade took the documents. He didn&#x2019;t open them, but held the papers atop one knee. He wondered if arrest would not have been preferable. He began to wake fully and bitterly.<br>Outside, the camp clattered, despite the wretched hour. A sergeant barked and soldiers answered. Chains chimed and horses whinnied. Hardie&#x2019;s arrival had yanked them all from sleep. His staff officers would be gathering by his tent, waiting to hear the news that had come from Washington.<br>How much had they guessed? Meade needed coffee. Coffee and John Reynolds. Reynolds was the man for this. Men followed him and loved him. Handsome John. He was the man to take command of the army. How foolish he himself had been to resent Reynolds&#x2019; advancement. He rued his pettiness now.<br>Meade sighed. He meant to rise and put on his uniform coat, to wrap his old bones in a guise of authority. But the flesh hesitated.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not qualified,&#x201d; he told Hardie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the devil&#x2019;s choice for this. I mustn&#x2019;t command this army.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the president&#x2019;s decision.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about Reynolds? Is it true he turned it down?&#x201d;<br>Hardie shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe there was a formal offer. Anyway, the president chose you, sir. General Halleck and Mr. Stanton concurred. They sent me to Frederick by special train. There&#x2019;s no time to lose.&#x201d;<br>Meade snapped, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I understand that?&#x201d;<br><i>Halleck.</i> The man was devoured by jealousy. Of Reynolds, that much was evident. Of Reynolds and so many others. Apparently, though, he wasn&#x2019;t jealous of everyone. What does that say of me? Meade asked himself.<br>He did his best to button up his temper. His wife had warned him, more than once, that his tongue cut worse than his sword.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the seniority on the Army rolls,&#x201d; Meade insisted. Then he added, &#x201c;I thought things had been patched up with General Hooker?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Lincoln lost faith in him.&#x201d;<br>So has the rest of this blasted army, Meade thought. Yet, removing Hooker now was madness. With battle looming. On a field yet unknown.<br>&#x201c;Hardie, I don&#x2019;t want this,&#x201d; he said in a tamed voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the man for this.&#x201d;<br>His visitor gestured toward the envelopes, which remained unopened. Meade unfolded the fateful order, bending to make out the words. Hardie took up the lantern again and brought it closer.<br>It was true. He had been selected as the latest general half-expected to fail and be damned forever.<br><i>Expected</i> to fail? Was that the nub of it?<br>Meade tested each word of the order, then studied the accompanying correspondence from the general-in-chief. &#x201c;Considering the circumstances,&#x201d; Meade read, &#x201c;no one has ever received a more important command.&#x201d;<br>A sharp-fanged creature slithered through his bowels.<br>Had it come to this? With the Confederates already marching on Philadelphia, for all he knew? For all anyone knew? The evening before, he had worn himself out riding through the Maryland countryside trying to find Hooker, the man who held the string and hid both ends. The raw, hot roads had been burdened with batteries and commissary wagons, with regiments coming late to their camps and with stragglers, some of them drunk. No one knew where the army&#x2019;s commander could be found.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want this,&#x201d; Meade said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible. I shall send a message to Halleck.&#x201d;<br>Fixing his spectacles higher on his nose, Hardie said, &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t do any good, sir. The president&#x2019;s mind is made up.&#x201d; He set the lantern back down on the desk.<br>Meade arched his back. The camp bed creaked. &#x201c;Does General Hooker know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He sent in a letter of resignation.&#x201d; A quarter-smile cut into Hardie&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure he meant it to be accepted. But it was.&#x201d; The smile turned cruel enough to tell Meade that Hooker had earned Hardie&#x2019;s enmity. &#x201c;I suspect he&#x2019;ll know by the time we reach army headquarters.&#x201d;<br>Meade snorted. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know where that is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll guide you there, if you&#x2019;ll loan me a horse. I came in a rented buggy.&#x201d;<br>Irritated anew that he had failed to find Hooker&#x2019;s camp the evening before, Meade asked, &#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re so well-informed, Hardie, would you happen to know where General Lee and his army are strolling just now? No one else seems to have any blasted idea. Certainly not this army&#x2019;s corps commanders.&#x201d;<br>The colonel shook his head. &#x201c;General Hooker&#x2019;s communications with Washington have been&nbsp;... limited.&#x201d; Posture deformed by the slope of the canvas, he shed another layer of formality. &#x201c;To tell you the truth, sir, he hasn&#x2019;t told us much of anything. He wouldn&#x2019;t even share his plan of campaign with Mr. Lincoln. All we heard from old Fighting Joe were calls for reinforcements and wails that the army&#x2019;s outnumbered. He sounded more and more like Little Mac. It set the president out of temper. And that&#x2019;s putting it soft.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hardie, do you know where the corps of <i>this</i> army are right now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not all of them. It took some work to find you.&#x201d;<br>The situation reminded Meade of a game he had seen blindfolded children play in Tampico. Spun round, they lashed out with a stick, trying to shatter a dangling plaster animal filled with treats. Except that there would be no treats this time. Only the blind lashing out.<br>Meade reached for his watch. Instead of metal, his hand met the sweat-heavy cloth of an undergarment. <i>Wake up,</i> he commanded himself. <i>Take hold of yourself.</i> &#x201c;What time is it, Hardie?&#x201d;<br>The colonel drew out his watch and clicked open the cover. &#x201c;Half past three, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll have a ride before us. If we must go through with this.&#x201d; He cleared his throat, tasting bile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a few moments alone. And you&#x2019;ll want your breakfast.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; The colonel turned to go.<br>&#x201c;Hardie?&#x201d;<br>Hand on the tent&#x2019;s flap, the visitor turned again. Reflections of the lantern&#x2019;s flame flickered on his spectacles.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been tried and condemned without a hearing, and I suppose I shall have to go to execution,&#x201d; Meade said. He attempted a smile and failed. &#x201c;Send Captain Meade to me. And tell my staff I&#x2019;ll join them shortly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shall I let them know, sir? About the order?&#x201d;<br>Meade brushed a fly from his beard. &#x201c;Do as you see fit.&#x201d;<br>Left alone, Meade clutched the paper that damned him. His bowels winced again. The flesh always reminded a man of the constraints on human dignity.<br>In those last private moments, he thought about young George. It had wounded Meade when the boy was cast from West Point for his follies. Now he himself had been pointed toward failure, toward a far greater failure, a failure that would resound for generations. Was it a curse on the family? His father, too, had failed, in a different way, in a different world.<br>Still waking to the charge that had been given him, Meade felt a wave of shame, as if one of those Barnegat rip currents had changed the direction of an inner sea. He needed to control himself, if he hoped to control the army. To put up a manly show. How could he have indulged in such fretting in front of Hardie? How could he have shown such weakness? Weariness was no excuse, nor was confusion.<br>He imagined the colonel telling tales at the bar in Willard&#x2019;s Hotel. He could hear the laughter of clerks and politicians.<br>Well, the thing was done.<br>In the sour air of his tent, Meade viewed himself with an engineer&#x2019;s cold eye: too dark of thought, too dour, a man alert to the smell of sulfur, but not to Heaven&#x2019;s scent. He could hear Margaret teasing, &#x201c;George, I know you can smile!&#x201d; His wife was a proud, loyal woman, of good family. She had got him a brigadier&#x2019;s rank at the start of the war, when his merits had not sufficed. He would have to do his best for her. And for the Union, of course.<br>Major General George Gordon Meade ha...</p><h2>Between Parent and Teenager,</h2><p>Presents parents with advice on the handling of everyday difficulties and serious crises which arise in the parent-teenager relationship</p><p></p><h2>Scar Tissue: A Brady Coyne Novel (Brady Coyne Novels)</h2><p>Brady Coyne is an attorney with a select clientele and a small practice - he handles mostly the boring paperwork such as deeds, wills, and divorces and leaves the more exciting aspects of the legal profession to others. A call from Jacob Gold, an old friend and client, on a cold February day, however, shatters the slow pace of Brady's life. Gold's fifteen year old son Brian and Brian's girlfriend Jenny were involved in a tragic accident. Their car went off the road and into a river - Jenny was DOA and Brian is missing, his body probably swept away by the river's current.<br> <br> With the parents paralyzed by grief, Brady - divorced with two sons of his own - agrees to help as much as he can. But what seems a simple, if tragic, situation quickly becomes complicated. The accident scene makes no sense to Brady, the police chief of this quiet, middle class Boston suburb seems particularly eager to be rid of Brady and then Jacob Gold moves out of his home and disappears. For the sake of his friends and clients, and for their child, Brady must now find out the truth that lurks behind this tragedy - before yet another innocent life is lost.<br></p><p>Brady Coyne is a Boston lawyer who'd rather be fishing than trying a case. Most of his clients are also his friends, so when Jake and Sharon Gold's 15-year-old son and his girlfriend are killed in a car accident, Brady tries to lighten their load by handling the details of the police investigation and the funeral arrangements. But Brian's body hasn't been recovered yet, despite the efforts of police divers at the accident scene. There are other signs that this was more than a typical scenario of teenage drivers taking a curve too fast, but the authorities don't seem interested in looking into them. Brady soon realizes that someone's applying political pressure to keep the lid on a secret everyone but Brady and the Golds seems to know about: a pornography ring in which a beloved community leader and the best and brightest local high school students are deeply involved. This is Coyne's 17th outing, as reliable a harbinger of fall as the first bonfire of the season. No big surprises here, but William Tapply's popular series continues to win fans charmed by his thoughtful hero, his solid plotting, and his smooth pacing. <i>--Jane Adams</i>"Tapply is the best there is today...A worthy successor to Hammet and Both MacDonalds (Ross and John)."-<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>Oustanding Praise for Willam G.

By the author of Saint Augustine. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><strong>Garry Wills</strong> has written many acclaimed and bestselling works, including <em>What Jesus Meant, Papal Sin, </em>and <em>Why I Am a Catholic</em>. His books have received many awards, including the Pulitzer Prize. A professor of history emeritus at Northwestern University, Wills is a frequent contributor to <em>The New York Review of Books </em>and other publications.Starred Review. Wills (<i>Why I Am a Catholic</i>) shares his personal practice of the rosary in a book that is both inspiring and refreshing. His approach excels chiefly in the reflections he has written on the gospel stories that are used as subjects of contemplation for each section of the rosary beads. In these, Wills relies extensively on the work of the late scripture scholar Raymond Brown to expand upon passages that have become overly familiar to many. The author's own translations of the Christian scriptures are a further enhancement, as is the inclusion of images by Renaissance artist Tintoretto. Though the rosary is often viewed as part of the life of Catholics before the sweeping changes wrought by the Second Vatican Council, Wills considers the devotion to be both timely and timeless. It is timely, he writes, quoting Pope John Paul II, because of its usefulness as a tool for quiet and regeneration in an increasingly noisy society, and timeless because its repetition of prayers said on a strand of beads is an ancient aid to contemplation. Wills begins the book with a brief history of the devotion and carefully explains how to take it up. His guide will be helpful to anyone interested in the rosary, but especially to those seeking new insights into its practice. <i>(Nov. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whenever I hear anyone sat that romance novels are nothing but tripe, I feel like giving them a copy of With This Ring and saying, "Read this, then we'll talk." </p><p><br>I can best describe With This Ring as an off-kilter regency variation of the Cinderella story. The Cinderella character is Lydia Perkins, the eldest daughter of a baronet. Her nemeses are her incredibly beautiful, incredibly stupid, incredibly spoiled-rotten selfish younger sister Kitty and their mother who indulges all of Kitty's pouts and tantrums and treats Lydia like a lady's maid. Their father hides in the library and avoids all conflict. </p><p><br>The kind of shabby prince is Major Samuel Reed, Lord Laren. He is an Earl but prefers to be known as Major Reed, not Lord Laren. Sam has suffered a shoulder wound, but hasn't had adequate treatment because he just can't bear the pain. He is staying with his wounded soldiers in an old church that's been turned into a hospital and meets Lydia and Kitty when they go there. It seems that all the fashionable fops think it great sport to come in and look at the wounded soldiers, but God forbid they touch them! Tender hearted Lydia pitches in and helps, to the horror of Kitty. </p><p><br>When the Perkins are attending a large banquet, Lydia exposes the horrible conditions the wounded soldiers are living in, and fickle Society turns on the Perkins family. Since this utterly ruins Kitty's chances for a fashionable marriage, Lydia's mother beats her in the face and turns her out of the house. When Lydia goes to the church to get her bonnet, Sam finds out what happened and comes to her rescue by proposing marriage. It seems that Sam has been writing to his family telling them all about his wonderful bride. Sam needs a wife and Lydia needs a home. They marry and begin the long trip to Sam's home. </p><p><br>On their journey, they are attacked by robbers, Sam is wounded again and they lose all their money. In this section, Carla Kelly introduces some of her delightful supporting characters. I fell in love with the surgeon, Mr. Wilburn, who treated Sam's wounds. A more kindhearted man I have yet to meet. Mr. and Mrs. Innis who own the inn where Sam and Lydia stay, are much better to Lydia than her own family. When Lydia desperately needs money, she cuts off and sells her hair. When the Innis's find out, Mrs. Innis and her daughter do the same. Let's see Kitty and Lady Perkins do that! During Sam's illness and convalescence, Lydia discovers that she is not the stupid, unlovely drudge that her mother and Kitty think she is, but a capable, attractive woman. Cinderella ends up not only rescuing the prince, but she falls in love with him too. </p><p><br>I didn't find one thing wrong with this book. It has two totally lovable main characters in Sam and Lydia, and a wonderful group of supporting characters. As for the villains, not very many of us have met truly evil people, but we have met people like Kitty and Lady Perkins; spoiled, petulant, and bone-deep selfish. The story never drags and is never rushed, and I, who normally do not like regencies that much, was utterly enchanted with it. </p><p><br>-- Ellen Micheletti, All About Romance <br>http: //www.likesbooks.com/cgi-bin/bookReview.pl?BookReviewId=3869<br>"Kelly has the rare ability to create realistic yet sympathetic characters that linger in the mind. <br>One of the most respected Regency writers." <br>--Library Journal</p></p><h2>How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time...and Have Her Beg for More!: The First and Only Book that Tells You Exactly How</h2><p>Recommends techniques for increasing sexual pleasure and discusses the importance of love, fantasies, and a healthy body for the enjoyment of sex</p><p>NAURA HAYDEN is an actress, singer, and author of five best-selling books, including <i>Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Energy, But Were Too Weak to Ask</i>, and <i>Isle of View (Say It Out Loud)</i>.

Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><b>1. REFLECTIONS IN A DOUBLE BOURBON</b> <p>James Bond, with two double bourbons inside him, sat in the final departure lounge of Miami Airport and thought about life and death.</p> <p>It was part of his profession to kill people. He had never liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as he knew how and forgot about it. As a secret agent who held the rare double-0 prefix&#x2014;the licence to kill in the Secret Service - it was his duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon. If it happened, it happened. Regret was unprofessional&#x2014;worse, it was death watch beetle in the soul.</p> <p>And yet there had been something curiously impressive about the death of the Mexican. It wasn't that he hadn't deserved to die. He was an evil man, a man they call in Mexico a capungo. A capungo is a bandit who will kill for as little as forty pesos, which is about twenty-five shillings&#x2014;though probably he had been paid more to attempt the killing of Bond&#x2014;and, from the look of him, he had been an instrument of pain and misery all his life. Yes, it had certainly been time for him to die; but when Bond had killed him, less than twenty-four hours before, life had gone out of the body so quickly, so utterly, that Bond had almost seen it come out of his mouth as it does, in the shape of a bird, in Haitian primitives.</p> <p>What an extraordinary difference there was between a body full of person and a body that was empty! Now there is someone, now there is no one. This had been a Mexican with a name and an address, an employment card and perhaps a driving licence. Then something had gone out of him, out of the envelope of flesh and cheap clothes, and had left him an empty paper bag waiting for the dustcart. And the difference, the thing that had gone out of the stinking Mexican bandit, was greater than all Mexico.</p> <p>Bond looked down at the weapon that had done it. The cutting edge of his right hand was red and swollen. It would soon show a bruise. Bond flexed the hand, kneading it with his left. He had been doing the same thing at intervals through the quick plane trip that had got him away. It was a painful process, but if he kept the circulation moving the hand would heal more quickly. One couldn't tell how soon the weapon would be needed again. Cynicism gathered at the corners of Bond's mouth.</p> <p>'National Airlines, Airline of the Stars', announces the departure of their flight NA 106 to La Guardia Field, New York. Will all passengers please proceed to gate number seven. All aboard, please.'</p> <p>The Tannoy switched off with an echoing click. Bond glanced at his watch. At least another ten minutes before Transamerica would be called. He signalled to a waitress and ordered another double bourbon on the rocks. When the wide, chunky glass came, he swirled the liquor round for the ice to blunt it down and swallowed half of it. He stubbed out the butt of his cigarette and sat, his chin resting on his left hand, and gazed moodily across the twinkling tarmac to where the last half of the sun was slipping gloriously into the Gulf.</p> <p>The death of the Mexican had been the finishing touch to a bad assignment, one of the worst&#x2014;squalid, dangerous and without any redeeming feature except that it had got him away from headquarters.</p> <p>A big man in Mexico had some poppy fields. The flowers were not for decoration. They were broken down for opium, which was sold quickly and comparatively cheaply by the waiters at a small cafe in Mexico City called the 'Madre de Cacao'. The Madre de Cacao had plenty of protection. If you needed opium you walked in and ordered what you wanted with your drink. You paid for your drink at the caisse and the man at the caisse told you how many noughts to add to your bill. It was an orderly commerce of no concern to anyone outside Mexico. Then, far away in England, the Government, urged on by the United Nations' drive against drug smuggling, announced that heroin would be banned in Britain. There was alarm in Soho and also among respectable doctors who wanted to save their patients agony. Prohibition is the trigger of crime. Very soon the routine smuggling channels from China, Turkey and Italy were run almost dry by the illicit stockpiling in England. In Mexico City, a pleasant-spoken Import and Export merchant called Blackwell had a sister in England who was a heroin addict. He loved her and was sorry for her and, when she wrote that she would die if someone didn't help, he believed that she wrote the truth and set about investigating the illicit dope traffic in Mexico. In due course, through friends and friends of friends, he got to the Madre de Cacao and on from there to the big Mexican grower. In the process, he came to know about the economics of the trade, and he decided that if he could make a fortune and at the same time help suffering humanity he had found the Secret of Life. Blackwell's business was in fertilisers. He had a warehouse and a small plant and a staff of three for soil testing and plant research. It was easy to persuade the big Mexican that, behind this respectable front, Blackwell's team could busy itself extracting heroin from opium. Carriage to England was swiftly arranged by the Mexican. For the equivalent of a thousand pounds a trip, every month one of the diplomatic couriers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carried an extra suitcase to London. The price was reasonable. The contents of the suitcase, after the Mexican had deposited it at the Victoria Station left-luggage office and had mailed the ticket to a man called Schwab, c/o Boox-an-Pix, Ltd, WCI, were worth twenty thousand pounds.</p> <p>Unfortunately Schwab was a bad man, unconcerned with suffering humanity. He had the idea that if American juvenile delinquents could consume millions of dollars' worth of heroin every year, so could their Teddy boy and girl cousins. In two rooms in Pimlico, his staff watered the heroin with stomach powder and sent it on its way to the dance halls and amusement arcades.</p> <p>Schwab had already made a fortune when the CID Ghost Squad got on to him. Scotland Yard decided to let him make a little more money while they investigated the source of his supply. They put a close tail on Schwab and in due course were led to Victoria Station and thence to the Mexican courier. At that stage, since a foreign country was concerned, the Secret Service had had to be called in and Bond was ordered to find out where the courier got his supplies and to destroy the channel at source.</p> <p>Bond did as he was told. He flew to Mexico City and quickly got to the Madre de Cacao. Thence, posing as a buyer for the London traffic, he got back to the big Mexican. The Mexican received him amiably and referred him to Blackwell. Bond had rather taken to Blackwell. He knew nothing about Blackwell's sister, but the man was obviously an amateur and his bitterness about the heroin ban in England rang true. Bond broke into his warehouse one night and left a thermite bomb. He then went and sat in a cafe a mile away and watched the flames leap above the horizon of rooftops and listened to the silver cascade of the fire-brigade bells. The next morning he telephoned Blackwell. He stretched a handkerchief across the mouthpiece and spoke through it.</p> <p>' Sorry you lost your business last night. I'm afraid your insurance won't cover those stocks of soil you were researching.'</p> <p>'Who's that? Who's speaking?' 'I'm from England. That stuff of yours has killed quite a lot of young people over there. Damaged a lot of others. Santos won't be coming to England any more with his diplomatic bag. Schwab will be in jail by tonight. That fellow Bond you've been seeing, he won't get out of the net either. The police are after him now.'</p> <p>Frightened words came back down the line.</p> <p>'All right, but just don't do it again. Stick to fertilisers.'</p> <p>Bond hung up.</p> <p>Blackwell wouldn't have had the wits. It was obviously the big Mexican who had seen through the false trail. Bond had taken the precaution to move his hotel, but that night, as he walked home after a last drink at the Copacabana, a man suddenly stood in his way. The man wore a dirty white linen suit and a chauffeur's white cap that was too big for his head. There were deep blue shadows under Aztec cheekbones. In one corner of the slash of a mouth there was a toothpick and in the other a cigarette. The eyes were bright pin-pricks of marihuana.</p> <p>'You like woman? Make jigajig?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'Coloured girl? Fine jungle tail?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No.'</p> <p>'Mebbe pictures?'</p> <p>The gesture of the hand slipping into the coat was so well known to Bond, so full of old dangers that when the hand flashed out and the long silver finger went for his throat. Bond was on balance and ready for it.</p> <p>Almost automatically, Bond went into the 'Parry Defence against Underhand Thrust' out of the book. His right arm cut across, his body swivelling with it. The two forearms met mid-way between the two bodies, banging the Mexican's knife arm off target and opening his guard for a crashing short-arm chin jab with Bond's left. Bond's stiff, locked wrist had not travelled far, perhaps two feet, but the heel of his palm, with fingers spread for rigidity, had come up and under the man's chin with terrific force. The blow almost lifted the man off the sidewalk. Perhaps it had been that blow that had killed the Mexican, broken his neck, but as he staggered back on his way to the ground, Bond had drawn back his right hand and slashed sideways at the taut, offered throat. It was the deadly hand-edge blow to the Adam's apple, delivered with the fingers locked into a blade, that had been the standby of the Commandos. If the Mexican was still alive, he was certainly dead before he hit the ground.</p> <p>Bond stood for a moment, his chest heaving, and looked at the crumpled pile of cheap clothes flung down in the dust. He glanced up and down the street. There was no one. Some cars passed. Others had perhaps passed during the fight, but it had been in the shadows. Bond knelt down beside the body. There was no pu...</p></p><h2>Getting Through the Night: Finding Your Way After the Loss of a Loved One</h2><p>Offers advice on coping with grief over the loss of a loved one and tells how to find consolation in Christian faith</p><p>Eugenia Price, one of our most beloved inspirational writers, offers this simply written yet profoundly valuable book for anyone struggling through the loss of a loved one.

Since his assassination in 1865, no American&#x2019;s words have become more familiar or more admired, and their enduring power has established him as one of our greatest writers. Now, in a groundbreaking study, the distinguished Lincoln scholar Douglas L. Wilson demonstrates that exploring Lincoln&#x2019;s presidential writing provides a window onto his presidency and a key to his accomplishments. <br><br><i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Sword</i> tells the story of how Lincoln developed his writing skills, how they served him for a time as a hidden presidential asset, how it gradually became clear that he possessed a formidable literary talent, and it reveals how writing came to play an increasingly important role in his presidency. &#x201c;By the time he came to write the Gettysburg Address,&#x201d; Wilson says, &#x201c;Lincoln was attempting to help put the horrific carnage of the Civil War in a positive light, and at the same time to do it in a way that would have constructive implications for the future. By the time he came to write the Second Inaugural Address, fifteen months later, he was quite consciously in the business of interpreting the war and its deeper meaning, not just for his contemporaries but for what he elsewhere called the &#x2018;vast future.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Illustrated with reproductions of Lincoln&#x2019;s original manuscripts, <i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Sword</i> affords an unprecedented look at a distinctively American writer.</p><p>Douglas L. Wilson is codirector of the Lincoln Studies Center at Knox College. His previous book, <i>Honor&#x2019;s Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln</i>, was awarded the Lincoln Prize in 1999. He lives in Galesburg, Illinois.Chapter One <br><br>Springfield Farewell <br><br>On the day before his fifty-second birthday, February 11, 1861, President-elect Abraham Lincoln boarded a train in Springfield, Illinois, and set off for Washington. Before leaving his hometown, he had said a series of good-byes. Ten days earlier he had paid an emotional visit to his aged stepmother and visited the grave of his father. He had hosted a public reception, personally greeting the hundreds of well-wishers who streamed into and out of his house at Eighth and Jackson. The day before, he had made a final, nostalgic visit to his law office and his law partner of sixteen years, William H. Herndon. Inside the Great Western Railway station, just prior to his train&#x2019;s departure, he gravely shook hands with the loyal contingent of close friends who had braved an early morning hour and drizzling rain to see him off. Ordinarily a man of remarkable self-control, Lincoln was unable to disguise his feelings. As he shook hands with his friends, according to a reporter on the scene, &#x201c;his face was pale and quivered with emotion so deep as to render him almost unable to utter a single word.&#x201d; <br><br>Lincoln&#x2019;s rare display of emotion must have been evident to the larger crowd of well-wishers waiting outside the station. They had gathered in the street, between the station and the &#x201c;stub,&#x201d; or sidetrack, into which the special train was backed for boarding, and Lincoln and his party had to pass through them to reach the train. &#x201c;As Mr. Lincoln mounted the platform of the car,&#x201d; observed another reporter, many in the crowd seemed &#x201c;deeply affected, and he himself scarcely able to check the emotions of the hour.&#x201d; The night before, he had told the reporters traveling with him that he would make no remarks at the station, but once inside the car, he changed his mind. He returned to the platform at the rear of the car and removed his hat. The crowd grew silent, and the men in the crowd responded by removing theirs. An old friend who was present, James C. Conkling, wrote the next day to his son: &#x201c;It was quite affecting. Many eyes were filled to overflowing as Mr. Lincoln uttered those few and simple words which you will see in the papers. His own breast heaved with emotion and he could scarcely command his feelings sufficiently to commence.&#x201d; <br><br>Different versions of Lincoln&#x2019;s &#x201c;few and simple words&#x201d; were reported in newspapers, but in 1887, his former secretaries, John G. Nicolay and John Hay, published an authoritative text of the speech, which they transcribed from a manuscript in Lincoln&#x2019;s own hand (see Fig. 1-1): <br><br>My friends&#x2014;No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe every thing. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being, who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me, and remain with you and be every where for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.<br><br>This handwritten text confirmed the judgment of the original Springfield audience that his farewell had been a very poignant and affecting speech. As many commentators have pointed out, these nine sentences admirably display Lincoln&#x2019;s talent for conciseness, for weaving together appropriate words and rhythms, and for saying ordinary things in an extraordinary and memorable way. This text is duly reported in all modern biographies and has been inscribed in stone at the Illinois State Capitol. But these words are not the ones he uttered at the railway station in 1861.<br>What Lincoln actually said on that occasion is difficult to determine with any degree of precision, for the contemporary accounts vary. What is clear from abundant testimony, and from the evidence of the manuscript itself, is that he wrote out this text not before the speech, but afterward, on the train. That his manuscript text is not an exact replication of the words he had spoken on the platform can be shown by a close comparison of the various accounts, but it is also evident from the many eyewitness reports of the dramatic climax of the occasion. The <i>New York Herald</i> reporter Henry Villard, who had been in Springfield covering the president-elect closely for six weeks, wrote in his report: &#x201c;Towards the conclusion of his remarks himself and audience were moved to tears. His exhortation to pray elicited choked exclamations of &#x2018;We will do it; we will do it.&#x2019; &#x201d; The dispatch that was most widely printed and whose text is probably the closest to what Lincoln said also noted the visible emotion in the audience and recorded a similar response: &#x201c;Loud applause and cries of &#x2018;We will pray for you.&#x2019; &#x201d; This spontaneous emotional exchange between Lincoln and the crowd seems to have escaped the notice of most of his biographers, but it is, in fact, clearly evident in all the on-the-scene accounts. <br><br>According to Lincoln&#x2019;s hometown paper, this touching moment was marked by his appealing to the crowd &#x201c;with the earnestness of a sudden inspiration of feeling.&#x201d; The report that would seem to be the nearest approximation of Lincoln&#x2019;s spoken words renders the passage this way: <br><br>He [Washington] never would have succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance for support, and I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance . . . <br><br>It was doubtless at this point that the crowd, responding to his emotional plea, began to erupt with cries of &#x201c;We will pray for you&#x201d; or &#x201c;We will do it,&#x201d; even before the conclusion of the sentence: <br><br>. . . without which I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain. <br><br>In his manuscript text, this earnest appeal for the prayers of his audience is present but deliberately muted and unobtrusively folded into the final sentence: &#x201c;To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.&#x201d; This raises an obvious question: why did Lincoln, in writing out a revised version of his speech, play down its most electrifying moment so that it virtually disappeared from view? One possibility is that he had second thoughts about how it would look to have his first public utterance as president-elect be a plea for prayers. Indeed, J. G. Holland recalled in his 1866 biography that there had been just such public comment at the time. But why Lincoln effectively suppressed what had been the most affecting part of his speech when he came to write it out is surely best understood not in terms of message but of medium. <br><br>Lincoln knew from long experience that addressing a live audience is very different from addressing readers on the page. A speaker before an audience has special tools at his command&#x2014;body language, gestures, facial expressions, volume and tone of voice, pace, and so on. Because he has direct contact with his audience, a speaker can gauge its mood and receptiveness and can take immediate advantage of its reactions. The writer must rely on other devices, and a seasoned practitioner of both forms of expression like Lincoln could be expected to adapt his text accordingly. In speaking to the crowd at the train station, for example, he could sense the emotion of the audience rising to meet his own and spontaneously put in an appeal for their prayers. But in an address for the consumption of silent and invisible readers, who were not in the grips of an emotional leave-taking, the situation would be very different. The appeal therefore had to take a different form. <br><br>What is of interest here is that Lincoln&#x2019;s manuscript text is not a reiteration of his speech, but a revision. Asked by Villard to write out his remarks after the speech, Lincoln knew instinctively that what he had said extemporaneously would have to be reshaped and reconstituted to work as well for readers as it had for those present at the send-off. And because he was a seasoned practitioner in the art of revision, this was a clear opportunity to improve upon what he had said. Looking at some of the differences between the spoken and the written versions affords an opportunity to see the results of this process. Take, for example, the sentence from the spoken version &#x201c;To this people I owe all that I am.&#x201d; In its revised form, this became &#x201c;To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.&#x201d; One of the most discerning admirers of Lincoln&#x2019;s writing, the historian Jacques Barzun, has called attention to this sentence in making the case that the key to &#x201c;Lincoln&#x2019;s extraordinary power&#x201d; as a writer was his ability &#x201c;to make his spirit felt.&#x201d; Lincoln&#x2019;s writing, Barzun argues, tends to reflect a complicated sense of himself in relation to his audience. In his typical self-deprecating way, he often managed to create an &#x201c;emotional distance&#x201d; between himself and his audience that he used to advantage in his speeches and writings. Nowhere is this clearer, according to Barzun, than in the second sentence of the Farewell Address. &#x201c;If we stop to think, we ask: &#x2018;This place&#x2019;?&#x2014;yes. But why &#x2018;<i>these</i> people&#x2019;? Why not &#x2018;you people,&#x2019; whom he was addressing from the train platform, or &#x2018;this place and the kindness of <i>its</i> people&#x2019;? . . . &#x2018;These&#x2019; is a stroke of genius,&#x201d; Barzun says, because i...</p><h2>Wild Boy: My Life in Duran Duran</h2><p>Wild Boy is the explosive first inside account of the rise and fall of Duran Duran. The band rose to conquer the globe with a string of unforgettable hits such as "Rio," "Hungry Like the Wolf," and "The Reflex." With Simon Le Bon as their frontman, they were the defining pop act of the 1980s, but Andy Taylor, the enigmatic lead guitarist, is widely acknowledged to have been their musical driving force.<br><br>Then, at the very height of their achievement in 1985, Duran Duran imploded. Now Andy shares the story of what went wrong. With searing honesty, he charts every moment of Duran Duran's roller-coaster rise from their early days as club musicians through to international superstardom. He captures the glamour and excitement of the band's epic video shoots and the opulence of their world tours.<br><br>He reveals the truth about the allegations of drug abuse and wild hedonism that dogged Duran Duran. Packed with more than twenty-five years worth of rock 'n' roll anecdotes, Andy tells of his time in the band The Power Station, and explains why Duran Duran reformed with its original line-up in 2003. <br><br>But Wild Boy is also a moving story on a human level, as Andy describes how the pressures of fame took a terrible personal toll on him and his family. Moving from hilarious to harrowing at the turn of a page, WILD BOY is a must-read for anyone who lived through the 1980s, or who cares about music.</p><p>Andy Taylor was born in a small fishing village in the North East of England in 1961. He learned to play guitar at the age of eight and as a teenager he toured American airbases in Germany with a cover band, before joining Duran Duran in 1980. In the five years that followed, the band would have ten Top 10 UK hit singles and two #1 hit singles in the U.S. before he left, and have gone on to sell 100 million records worldwide. A hugely accomplished musician, having worked with artists as diverse as Robert Palmer, Rod Stewart, and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, Andy lives with his wife Tracey and their family in Ibiza.In this sincere though slight autobiography, Taylor, guitarist for the 1980s pop band Duran Duran, delivers an extended backstage look at the band's rise and fall. He includes an album-by-album look at how the band, which combined glam fashion and keyboard-driven synthpop with outrageous (and expensive) videos featuring exotic locales such as Sri Lanka, became synonymous with early MTV. Taylor discusses&#x2014;sometimes underplays&#x2014;the band's outrageous drug and alcohol habits&#x2014;much of which was better covered in MTV's 1999 <i>Behind The Music</i> segment. He is clearly aware that the band's materialistic image was a key part of London's transformation in the 1980s into a city where it was a dominant part of popular culture to aspire to be successful. The frustrating part is that his attempts to put Duran Duran into a wider musical perspective are far too infrequent, and his own story can't quite carry the narrative. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jacobson and Gottman, professors at the University of Washington, use their work to shatter myths and shed new light on abusive relationships.<p> They introduce two types of batterers: Cobras and Pit Bulls. The Cobras, the more severely violent of the two, strike swiftly and ferociously, always remaining in control and feeling entitled to whatever they want, whenever they want it. Pit Bulls are more likely to lose control, letting their emotions burn slowly until they explode in anger. The research is brought to life with stories of real couples such as George and Vicky. We see the few months of happiness in their marriage before George's Cobra-like outbursts begin, and witness Vicky's desire to make their failing relationship work. </p><p> Research results and advice are woven throughout such accounts of how real people handled their situations. The authors address the many dangers of leaving an abusive spouse and the importance of forming a safety plan before doing so. Jacobson and Gottman do not come to optimistic conclusions about the ability to stop domestic violence or reform abusive men, but they <i>are</i> optimistic about the women. Their studies follow many women such as Vicky who ultimately left and began the difficult and courageous work of converting nightmares into dreams. <i>--Amy Sessler</i></p>John Gottman, Ph.D, is Professor of Psychology at the University of Washington, where he has been studying marriages for the past twenty-two years.

It was the rain, she concluded. Under most circumstances she would have been far more observant. Traveling abroad she made it a point to pay strict attention when she found herself in unfamiliar surroundings. But this was London. One did not expect to be kidnapped straight off the street in broad daylight.</p><p>True, she had been distracted when she left the lecture hall. She was still fuming because of the countless inaccuracies in Dr. Potter&#x2019;s lecture on the American West. The man was a benighted fool. He had never so much as set foot outside of England, let alone bothered to read her pieces in the Flying Intelligencer. Potter knew nothing of the West, yet he dared to present himself as an authority on the subject. It had been too much to take sitting down, so of course she had been forced to stand up and raise some serious objections.</p><p>That had not gone over well with Potter or his audience. She had been escorted out of the lecture hall by two stout attendants. She had heard the muffled snickers and disapproving sniffs from the crowd. Respectable ladies did not interrupt noted lecturers with the goal of correcting them. Luckily, none of those in the audience were aware of her identity. Really, one had to be so careful in London.</p><p>Irritated and eager to escape the dreary summer rain, she had leaped into the first cab that stopped in the street. That proved to be a serious mistake.</p><p>She barely had time to register the odd, shuttered windows and the presence of the other occupant before the man wrapped an arm around her neck and hauled her close against his chest. He pressed the tip of a very sharp object to her throat. Out of the corner of her eye she saw that he gripped a scalpel in one gloved hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Silence or I&#x2019;ll slice open your throat before it&#x2019;s time, little whore. And that would be a pity. I&#x2019;m so looking forward to photographing you.&#x201d;</p><p>He spoke in a harsh whisper but the accent was unmistakably upper-class. His face was covered by a mask fashioned out of black silk. Openings for his eyes, nose and mouth had been cut into the fabric. He smelled of sweat, spice-scented cigarettes and expensive cologne. She was vaguely aware of the fine quality wool of his coat because of the way he held her pinned against him.</p><p>He moved, reaching out and around her to pull the door shut. The vehicle jolted into motion. She could tell that the carriage was moving at a rapid clip, but with the view through the windows blocked by the heavy wooden shutters she had little sense of direction.</p><p>One thing was evident immediately. Her captor was stronger than she was.</p><p>She stopped struggling and allowed her arms to go limp. Her right hand rested on the elegant fan attached to the silver chain at her waist.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want with me?&#x201d; she asked, striving for a thoroughly indignant and outraged tone of voice.</p><p>But she knew the answer. She had known it from the moment she saw the scalpel. She had fallen into the clutches of the fiend the press had labeled the Bridegroom. She struggled to keep her voice cold and assertive. If there was one thing she had learned in her travels, it was that an air of coolheaded self-control was often the most useful defense in a crisis.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a lovely wedding portrait of you, my sweet little harlot,&#x201d; the killer crooned.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to my purse but I must warn you that there is very little of value inside.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You think I want your purse, whore? I have no need of your money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why are we going through this pointless exercise?&#x201d; she snapped. </p><p>Her insulting tone enraged him.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut your mouth,&#x201d; he rasped. &#x201c;I will tell you why I have taken you. I am going to make an example of you, just as I have done with the other women who displayed a similar lack of shame. You will learn the price of your deception.&#x201d;</p><p>She did not think that it was possible to be any more frightened, but an even more intense wave of terror swept through her at his words. If she did not take some action to free herself, she would not survive the night. And she was quite certain she would only get one chance. She had to plan well.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you have made a great mistake, sir,&#x201d; she said, trying to project conviction into the words. &#x201c;I have deceived no one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You lie very well, Miss Doncaster, but you may save your breath. I know exactly what you are. You are just like the others. You give the outward appearance of feminine purity but underneath the fa�ade you are tainted goods. The rumors of your shameful behavior while abroad reached my ears this past week. I am aware that you seduced Benedict Stanbridge and convinced him that, as a gentleman, he has no choice but to marry you. I am going to save him from the trap you set for him, just as I saved the other gentlemen who were deceived.&#x201d; The killer traced the blade lightly around her throat, not quite piercing the skin. &#x201c;Will he be grateful, I wonder?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think to protect Mr. Stanbridge from the likes of me?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You are wasting your time. I assure you, Benedict Stanbridge is quite capable of taking care of himself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think to trap him into marriage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you feel that strongly about the matter, why don&#x2019;t you wait until he returns to London? You can inform him of your theories concerning my virtue and allow him to draw his own conclusions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Miss Doncaster. Stanbridge will discover the truth about you soon enough. Meanwhile, the Polite World will learn what you are tomorrow morning. Don&#x2019;t move or I will slit your throat here and now.&#x201d;</p><p>She held herself very still. The tip of the scalpel did not waver. She contemplated the possibility of slipping away from the blade and hurling herself to one side of the seat. But such a maneuver, even if successful, would buy her only a few seconds at most. She would find herself trapped in the corner, her tessen against the scalpel.</p><p>The Bridegroom was unlikely to murder her inside the carriage, she thought. It would be far too messy, to say the least. Surely there would be a great deal of blood and that would require an explanation to someone, even if only to the coachman. Everything about the killer, from his elegantly knotted tie to the furnishings of his vehicle, indicated that he was the fastidious sort. He would not ruin his fine suit and the velvet cushions if he could avoid it.</p><p>She concluded that her best chance would come when he attempted to remove her from the carriage. She gripped the closed tessen and waited.</p><p>The killer reached across the seat to a small box that sat on the opposite cushion. When she caught the telltale whiff of chloroform, another current of panic arced through her. She no longer possessed the option of waiting for the carriage to halt. Once she was unconscious she would be helpless.</p><p>&#x201c;This will keep you quiet until we reach our destination,&#x201d; the Bridegroom said. &#x201c;Never fear, I will wake you when it is time for you to put on your wedding gown and pose for your portrait. Now, then, lean back in the corner. That&#x2019;s a good girl. You will soon learn to obey me.&#x201d;</p><p>He prodded her with the scalpel, forcing her to edge toward the corner. She tightened her grip on the fan. The killer glanced down but he was not alarmed by her small action. She could not see his expression because of the mask but she was quite sure that he was smiling. He no doubt enjoyed the sight of a helpless woman clutching piteously at an attractive bit of frippery attached to her gown.</p><p>He readied the chloroform-soaked rag, preparing to clamp it across her nose and mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Just breathe deeply,&#x201d; he urged her. &#x201c;It will all be over in a moment.&#x201d;</p><p>She did what any delicately bred lady would do under such circumstances. She uttered a deep sigh, raised her eyes toward the heavens and fainted. She took care not to collapse straight onto the blade, sliding sideways along the seat instead. From there she started to tumble off the cushion onto the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody hell,&#x201d; the Bridegroom grumbled.</p><p>He moved instinctively to avoid the weight of her body.</p><p>The blade of the scalpel was no longer pointed directly at her throat. As if in answer to her silent prayers, the coachman turned a sharp corner at speed. The vehicle lurched to one side. The Bridegroom automatically sought to steady himself.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>She straightened, twisted and stabbed the sharpened steel ribs of the folded fan into the nearest target, the killer&#x2019;s thigh. The points bit deep through clothing and flesh.</p><p>The Bridegroom screamed in surprise and pain. He slashed at her with the scalpel but she already had the tessen open. The steel leaves of the fan deflected the blow.</p><p>&#x201c;Bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>Startled and off balance, the killer tried to ready himself for another strike. She snapped the fan closed and stabbed the points deep into his shoulder. The hand holding the scalpel spasmed in a reflexive action. The blade landed on the floor of the vehicle.</p><p>She yanked the tessen free and stabbed wildly a third time, heedless of her target. She was in a panic, desperate to free herself from the carriage. The Bridegroom shrieked again and batted at her, trying to ward off the blows. He groped for the fallen scalpel.</p><p>She opened the fan again, revealing the elegant garden scene etched into the steel, and slashed at the killer&#x2019;s hand with the edges of the razor-sharp leaves. He jerked back, shrieking in rage.</p><p>The carriage slammed to a jarring halt. The coachman had evidently heard the screams.</p><p>She clawed at the door and managed to get it open. She closed the tessen and let it dangle from the chatelaine. Seizing handfuls of her skirts and petticoats in one hand to keep the yards of fabric out of the way, she scrambled out of the vehicle.</p><p>&#x201c;What the bloody hell?&#x201d; The coachman stared at her from the box, rain dripping off the brim of his low-crowned hat. He was clearly stunned by the turn of events. &#x201c;Here, now, what&#x2019;s this all about? He said you was his lady friend. Said the two of you wanted a bit of privacy.&#x201d;</p><p>She did not stop to explain the situation. She dared not trust the coachman. He might be innocent but he might just as easily be in league with the killer.</p><p>A quick glance showed her that the vehicle had come to a halt in a narrow lane. Once again she hiked up her skirts and petticoats. She fled toward the far end where the cross street promised traffic and safety.</p><p>She heard the coachman crack his whip behind her. The horse broke into a frenzied gallop, hoofs ringing on the stones. The carriage clattered away in the opposite direction. The anguished, enraged howls from inside the cab grew faint.</p><p>She ran for her life.</p><p>There was more screaming when she reached the cross street. A woman pushing a baby in a perambulator was the first person to see her rush out of the dark lane. The nanny uttered a high, shrill screech.</p><p>Her horrified cry immediately attracted a crowd. Everyone stared, shock and fascinated horror etching their faces. A constable appeared. He hurried toward her, baton in hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re bleeding, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>She looked down and saw for the first time that her dress was splashed with blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Not mine,&#x201d; she said quickly.</p><p>The constable assumed a forbidding air. &#x201c;Who did you kill, then, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Bridegroom,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think. The thing is, I&#x2019;m not certain that he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>Doctor Who: The Day of the Doctor (Target Collection) (Doctor Who: Target Collection)</h2><p>Meet the new Doctor Who classics. <br>When the entire universe is at stake, three different Doctors will unite to save it. <br>The Tenth Doctor is hunting shape-shifting Zygons in Elizabethan England.

Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: "Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance." Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Beauty Of Spiritual Language</h2><p><p>There are few other topics on which Christians are so divided.

Using Briggs's book, even those with little space can encourage a wide variety of visitors. Briggs's science background and writing skills make this a worthwhile guide that subtly calls attention to habitat loss while providing meaningful ways gardeners can help. Chapters are organized by habitats: woodlands, wetlands, grasslands, and rocklands. Briggs is thorough, giving brief historical and ecological background on each habitat along with suggestions on how to re-create it at home. Unfortunately, since her book was originally published in Britain, her plant lists may be of limited use to American gardeners. Unlike Briggs, natural history writer Zickefoose, whose work often appears in Bird Watcher's Digest, includes plant lists for various U.S. regions, though her emphasis is on habitats for birds. There are the usual recommendations on plants and water features, but also included are detailed chapters on housing, feeding, and creating hospitable habitats with living fences, brush piles, and snags. Zickefoose openly discusses the ugly side of attracting birds (disease problems, window-kills, predators, and pests). Points are punctuated by sidebars in which birders relate their experiences. The final chapter comprises observations by naturalists and authors across the United States. Recommended for all public libraries and essential for those lacking Sally Roth's Attracting Birds to Your Backyard (Rodale, 1998). Harris's less-detailed book is designed for those who wish to attract birds and butterflies but who have little knowledge of gardening or wildlife. Harris offers beginners a nice section on planning gardens and a short, attractive directory of plants. One strength of this book is its large color illustrations depicting wildlife and illustrating the steps taken in creating such projects as trellises, backyard blinds, and homemade bird feeders. An attractive book recommended for libraries needing to update. Bonnie Poquette, Shorewood P.L., WI <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Want warblers in your wisteria? Sparrows in your spirea? Attracting birds can be as simple as scattering seed, but dedicated gardeners interested in making a more substantial commitment to sustaining and sheltering birds will find an abundance of practical information in this comprehensive guide to creating welcoming habitats, from wildflower meadows to wild mounds of brush, from berry patches to backyard ponds, features easy to incorporate in any garden design. With expertise and enthusiasm, the authors offer incisive, in-depth material on such critical topics as thwarting predators, installing water features, and constructing feeding stations. Augmented by handy "quick reference" charts and topical Q&amp;A sections, much of the guide is organized by "ecoregions," since specific geographic areas support different bird species. Extolling both their beauty and their benefits, this is one garden handbook that is positively "for the birds." <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

John Harrison was born in the Peak District and now lives in London.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>tegeus-Cromis, sometime soldier and sophisticate of Viriconium, the Pastel City, who now dwelt quite alone in a tower by the sea and imagined himself a better poet than swordsman, stood at early morning on the sand dunes that lay between his tall home and the grey line of the surf. Like swift and tattered scraps of rag, black gulls sped and fought over his downcast head. It was a catastrophe that had driven him from his tower, something that he had witnessed from its topmost room during the night.<br><br>He smelled burning on the offshore wind. In the distance, faintly, he could hear dull and heavy explosions: and it was not the powerful sea that shook the dunes beneath his feet.<br><br>Cromis was a tall man, thin and cadaverous. He had slept little lately, and his green eyes were tired in the dark sunken hollows above his high, prominent cheekbones.<br><br>He wore a dark green velvet cloak, spun about him like a cocoon against the wind; a tabard of antique leather set with iridium studs over a white kid shirt; tight mazarine velvet trousers and high, soft boots of pale blue suede. Beneath the heavy cloak, his slim and deceptively delicate hands were curled into fists, weighted, as was the custom of the time, with heavy rings of nonprecious metals intagliated with involved cyphers and sphenograms. The right fist rested on the pommel of his plain long sword, which, contrary to the fashion of the time, had no name. Cromis, whose lips were thin and bloodless, was more possessed by the essential qualities of things than by their names; concerned with the reality of Reality, rather than with the names men gave it.<br><br>He worried more, for instance, about the beauty of the city that had fallen during the night than he did that it was Viriconium, the Pastel City. He loved it more for its avenues paved in pale blue and for its alleys that were not paved at all than he did for what its citizens chose to call it, which was often Viricon the Old and The Place Where the Roads Meet.<br><br>He had found no rest in music, which he loved, and now he found none on the pink sand.<br><br>For a while he walked the tideline, examining the objects cast up by the sea: paying particular attention to a smooth stone here, a translucent spiny shell there, picking up a bottle the colour of his cloak, throwing down a branch whitened and peculiarly carved by the water. He watched the black gulls, but their cries depressed him. He listened to the cold wind in the rowan woods around his tower, and he shivered. Over the pounding of the high tide, he heard the dull concussions of falling Viriconium. And even when he stood in the surf, feeling its sharp acid sting on his cheek, lost in its thunder, he imagined it was possible to hear the riots in the pastel streets, the warring factions, and voices crying for Young Queen, Old Queen.<br><br>He settled his russet shovel hat more firmly; crossed the dunes, his feet slipping in the treacherous sand; and found the white stone path through the rowans to his tower, which also had no name: though it was called by some after the stretch of seaboard on which it stood, that is, Balmacara. Cromis knew where his heart and his sword lay--but he had thought that all finished with and he had looked forward to a comfortable life by the sea.<br>When the first of the refugees arrived, he knew who had won the city, or the shell of it that remained, but the circumstances of his learning gave him no pleasure.<br><br>It was before noon, and he had still not decided what to do.<br><br>He sat in his highest room (a circular place, small, the walls of which were lined with leather and shelves of books; musical and scientific objects, astrolabes and lutes, stood on its draped stone tables; it was here that he worked at his songs), playing softly an instrument that he had got under strange circumstances some time ago, in the East. Its strings were taut and harsh, and stung his finger ends; its tone was high and unpleasant and melancholy, but that was his mood. He played in a mode forgotten by all but himself and certain desert musicians, and his thoughts were not with the music.<br><br>From the curved window of the room he could see out over the rowans and the gnarled thorn to the road that ran from the unfortunate city to Duirinish in the Northeast. Viriconium itself was a smoke haze above the eastern horizon and an unpleasant vibration in the foundations of the tower. He saw a launch rise out of that haze, a speck like a trick of the eye.<br><br>It was well-known in the alleys of the city, and in remoter places, that, when tegeus-Cromis was nervous or debating within himself, his right hand strayed constantly to the pommel of his nameless sword: then was hardly the time to strike, and there was no other. He had never noticed it himself. He put down his instrument and went over to the window.<br><br>The launch gained height, gyring slowly, flew a short way north while Cromis strained his eyes, and then began to make directly toward Balmacara. For a little while, it appeared to be stationary, merely growing larger as it neared the tower.<br><br>When it came close enough to make out detail, Cromis saw that its faceted crystal hull had been blackened by fire, and that a great rift ran the full length of its starboard side. Its power plant (the secret of which, like many other things, had been lost a thousand years before the rise of Viriconium, so that Cromis and his contemporaries lived on the corpse of an ancient science, dependent on the enduring relics of a dead race) ran with a dreary insectile humming where it should have been silent. A pale halo of St. Elmo's fire crackled from its bow to its stern, coruscating. Behind the shattered glass of its canopy, Cromis could see no pilot, and its flight was erratic: it yawed and pitched aimlessly, like a waterbird on a quiet current.<br><br>Cromis's knuckles stood out white against the sweat-darkened leather of his sword hilt as the vehicle dived, spun wildly, and lost a hundred feet in less than a second. It scraped the tops of the rowans, shuddered like a dying animal, gained a few precious, hopeless feet. It ploughed into the wood, discharging enormous sparks, its motors wailing. A smell of ozone was in the air.<br><br>Before the wreckage had hit the ground, Cromis was out of the high room, and, cloak streaming about him, was descending the spiral staircase at the spine of the tower.<br><br>At first, he thought the entire wood had caught fire.<br><br>Strange, motionless pillars of flame sprang up before him, red and gold, and burnished copper. He thought, We are at the mercy of these old machines; we know so little of the forces that drive them. He threw up his arm to guard his face against the heat:<br><br>And realised that most of the flames he saw were merely autumn leaves, the wild colours of the dying year. Only two or three of the rowans were actually burning. They gave off a thick white smoke and a not-unpleasant smell. So many different kinds of fire, he thought. Then he ran on down the white stone path, berating himself for a fool.<br><br>Unknown to him, he had drawn his sword.<br><br>Having demolished a short lane through the rowans, the launch lay like an immense split fruit, the original rent in its side now a gaping black hole through which he could discern odd glimmers of light. It was as long as his tower was tall. It seemed unaffected by its own discharges, as if the webs of force that latticed the crystal shell were of a different order than that of heat; something cold, but altogether powerful. Energy drained from it, and the discharges became fewer. The lights inside its ruptured hull danced and changed position, like fireflies of an uncustomary colour.<br><br>No man could have lived through that, Cromis thought. He choked on the rowan smoke.<br><br>He had begun to turn sadly away when a figure staggered out of the wreckage toward him, swaying.<br><br>The survivor was dressed in charred rags, his face blackened by beard and grime. His eyes shone startlingly white from shadowed pits, and his right arm was a bloody, bandaged stump. He gazed about him, regarding the burning rowans with fear and bemusement: he, too, seemed to see the whole wood as a furnace. He looked directly at Cromis.<br><br>"Help!" he cried. "Help!"<br><br>He shuddered, stumbled, and fell. A bough dropped from one of the blazing trees. Fire licked at the still body.<br><br>Cromis hurled himself forward, hacking a path through the burning foliage with his sword. Cinders settled on his cloak, and the air was hot. Reaching the motionless body, he sheathed the blade, hung the man over his shoulders like a yoke, and started away from the crippled launch. There was an unpleasant, exposed sensation crawling somewhere in the back of his skull. He had made a hundred yards, his breath coming hard as the unaccustomed exertion began to tell, when the vehicle exploded. A great soundless gout of white cold fire, locked in the core of the launch by a vanished art, dissipated itself as pure light, a millennium after its confinement.<br><br>It did him no harm: or none that he could recognise.<br><br>As he reached the gates of Balmacara, something detached itself from the raggy clothing of the survivor and fell to the ground: a drawstring pouch of goat shagreen, full of coin. Possibly, in some dream, he heard the thud and ring of his portion of the fallen city. He shifted and moaned. There was at least one more bag of metal on him; it rattled dully as he moved. tegeus-Cromis curled his upper lip. He had wondered why the man was so heavy.<br>Once inside the tower, he recovered quickly. Cromis ministered to him in one of the lower rooms, giving him stimulants and changing the blood-stiffened bandage on the severed arm, which had been cauterised negligently and was beginning to weep a clear, unhealthy fluid. The room, which was hung with weapons and curiosities of old campaigns, began to smell of burned cloth and pungent drugs.<br><br>The survivor woke, flinched when he saw Cromis, his remaining hand clawing at the blue embroidered silks of the wall-bed on which he lay. He was a heavy-boned man of medium height, and seemed to be of the lower merchant classes, a vendor of wine, perhaps, or women. The pupils of his black eyes were dilated, their whites large and veined with red. He seemed to relax a little. Cromis took his shoulders, and, as gently as he was able, pressed him down.<br><br>"Rest yourself," he told him. "You are in the tower of tegeus-Cromis, that some men call Balmacara. I must know your name if we are to talk."<br><br>The black eyes flickered warily round the walls. They touched briefly on a powered battle-axe that Cromis had got from his friend Tomb the Dwarf after the sea fight at Mingulay in the Rivermouth campaign; moved to the gaudy green-and-gold standard of Thorisman Carlemaker, whom Cromis had defeated single-handed--and with regret, since he had no quarrel with the fine rogue--in the Mountains of Monadliath; came finally to rest on the hilt of the intangible-bladed baan that had accidentally killed Cromis's sister Galen. He looked from that to Cromis.<br><br>"I am Ronoan Mor, a merchant." There was open suspicion in his eyes and in his voice. He fumbled beneath his clothing. "You have strange tastes," he said, nodding at the relics on the wall. Cromis, noting the fumbling hand, smiled.<br><br>"Your coin fell as I carried you from your launch, Ronoan Mor." He pointed to where the three purses lay on an inlaid table. "You will find that all of it is present. How are things in the Pastel City?"<br><br>It could not have been the money that worried Ronoan Mor, for the wariness did not leave his face. And that was a surprising thing. He bared his teeth.<br><br>"Hard," he muttered, gazing bitterly at his severed limb. He hawked deep in his throat, and might have spat had there been a receptacle. "The young bitch holds steady, and we were routed. But--"<br><br>There was such a look of fanaticism in his eyes that Cromis's hand, of its own accord, began to caress the pommel of the nameless sword. He was more puzzled than angered by Mor's insult to the Young Queen. If a man normally given to dreaming of bargain prices and a comfortable retirement (if of anything at all) could show this measure of devotion to a political cause, then things were truly out of joint in the land. Immediately, he found himself thinking: And did you need to know that, Sir Cromis? Is it not enough that the Pastel Towers shudder and fall overnight? There must be further proof?<br><br>But he smiled and interrupted Mor, saying softly, "That is not so hard, sir."<br><br>For a moment, the survivor went on as if he had not heard:<br><br>"--But she cannot hold for long when Canna Moidart's Northern allies join with those patriots left in the city--"<br><br>There was a feverish, canting tone in his voice, as though he repeated a creed. Sweat broke out on his brow, and spittle appeared on his lips. "Aye, we'll have her then, for sure! And caught between two blades--"<br><br>He held his tongue and studied Cromis closely, squinting. Cromis stared levelly back, endeavouring not to show how this intelligence affected him. Mor clawed himself into a sitting position, trembling with the effort.<br><br>"Wise to reveal yourself, tegeus-Cromis!" he cried suddenly, like an orator who singles one man from a crowd of rustics. "Where does your service lie?"<br><br>"You tire yourself needlessly," murmured Cromis. "It matters little to me," he lied, "for, as you see, I am a recluse. But I admit myself interested in this tale of the Old Queen and her Northern cousins. She has a large following, you say?"<br><br>As if in answer, Ronoan Mor's good hand fumbled in his clothing again. And this time, it drew forth a twelve-inch sliver of flickering green light that hissed and crackled:<br><br>A baan.<br><br>He drew back his lips, held the ancient weapon stiffly before him (all men fear them, even their users), and snarled, "Large enough for you, sir. You see"--he glanced sideways at the trophies on the wall--"others may hold forceblades. Northerners, they tell me, have many such. With whom does your service lie, tegeus-Cromis?" He twitched the baan so it sparked and spat. "Tell me! Your evasions weary me--"</p>
